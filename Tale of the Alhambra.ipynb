       "of mountains, destitute of shrub or tree, and mottled with variegated\n",

       "traversing these lofty sierras the traveller is often obliged to alight,\n",
       "and lead his horse up and down the steep and jagged ascents and\n",
       "descents, resembling the broken steps of a staircase. Sometimes the road\n",
       "winds along dizzy precipices, without parapet to guard him from the\n",

       "of the mountain a herd of fierce Andalusian bulls, destined for the\n",
       "combat of the arena. I have felt, if I may so express it, an agreeable\n",
       "horror in thus contemplating, near at hand, these terrific animals,\n",
       "clothed with tremendous strength, and ranging their native pastures in\n",
       "untamed wildness, strangers almost to the face of man: they know no one\n",

       "about twenty years of age, who was to be our guide, our groom, our\n",
       "valet, and at all times our guard. For the latter office he was provided\n",
       "with a formidable trabuco or carbine, with which he promised to defend\n",
       "us against rateros or solitary footpads; but as to powerful bands, like\n",
       "that of the “Sons of Ecija,” he confessed they were quite beyond his\n",
       "prowess. He made much vainglorious boast about his weapon at the outset\n",

       "with funds for the purpose; we took care, however, to give the latter a\n",
       "private hint, that, though we made a close bargain with his master, it\n",
       "was all in his favor, as, if he proved a good man and true, both he and\n",
       "the horses should live at our cost, and the money provided for their\n",
       "maintenance remain in his pocket. This unexpected largess, with the\n",
       "occasional present of a cigar, won his heart completely. He was, in\n",
       "truth, a faithful, cheery, kind-hearted creature, as full of saws and\n",
       "proverbs as that miracle of squires, the renowned Sancho himself, whose\n",
       "name, by the by, we bestowed upon him, and, like a true Spaniard,\n",
       "though treated by us with companionable familiarity, he never for a\n",
       "moment, in his utmost hilarity, overstepped the bounds of respectful\n",
       "decorum.\n",
       "\n",
       "Such were our minor preparations for the journey, but above all we laid\n",
       "in an ample stock of good-humor, and a genuine disposition to be\n",
       "pleased; determining to travel in true contrabandista style; taking\n",
       "things as we found them, rough or smooth, and mingling with all classes\n",
       "and conditions in a kind of vagabond companionship. It is the true way\n",
       "to travel in Spain. With such disposition and determination, what a\n",
       "country is it for a traveller, where the most miserable inn is as full\n",
       "of adventure as an enchanted castle, and every meal is in itself an\n",
       "achievement! Let others repine at the lack of turnpike roads and\n",
       "sumptuous hotels, and all the elaborate comforts of a country cultivated\n",
       "and civilized into tameness and commonplace; but give me the rude\n",
       "mountain scramble; the roving, hap-hazard, wayfaring; the half wild, yet\n",
       "frank and hospitable manners, which impart such a true game-flavor to\n",
       "dear old romantic Spain!\n",

       "half-past six in the morning of a bright May day, in company with a lady\n",
       "and gentleman of our acquaintance, who rode a few miles with us, in the\n",
       "Spanish mode of taking leave. Our route lay through old Alcala de\n",
       "Guadaira (Alcala on the river Aira), the benefactress of Seville, that\n",
       "supplies it with bread and water. Here live the bakers who furnish\n",
       "Seville with that delicious bread for which it is renowned; here are\n",
       "fabricated those roscas well known by the well-merited appellation of\n",
       "_pan de Dios_ (bread of God); with which, by the way, we ordered our\n",
       "man, Sancho, to stock his alforjas for the journey. Well has this\n",
       "beneficent little city been denominated the “Oven of Seville”; well has\n",
       "it been called Alcala de los Panaderos (Alcala of the bakers), for a\n",
       "great part of its inhabitants are of that handicraft, and the highway\n",
       "hence to Seville is constantly traversed by lines of mules and donkeys\n",
       "laden with great panniers of loaves and roscas.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have said Alcala supplies Seville with water. Here are great tanks or\n",
       "reservoirs, of Roman and Moorish construction, whence water is conveyed\n",
       "to Seville by noble aqueducts. The springs of Alcala are almost as much\n",
       "vaunted as its ovens; and to the lightness, sweetness, and purity of its\n",
       "water is attributed in some measure the delicacy of its bread.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here we halted for a time, at the ruins of the old Moorish castle, a\n",
       "favorite resort for picnic parties from Seville, where we had passed\n",
       "many a pleasant hour. The walls are of great extent, pierced with\n",
       "loopholes; enclosing a huge square tower or keep, with the remains of\n",
       "masmoras, or subterranean granaries. The Guadaira winds its stream round\n",
       "the hill, at the foot of these ruins, whimpering among reeds, rushes,\n",
       "and pond-lilies, and overhung with rhododendron, eglantine, yellow\n",
       "myrtle, and a profusion of wild flowers and aromatic shrubs; while along\n",
       "its banks are groves of oranges, citrons, and pomegranates, among which\n",
       "we heard the early note of the nightingale.\n",
       "\n",
       "A picturesque bridge was thrown across the little river, at one end of\n",
       "which was the ancient Moorish mill of the castle, defended by a tower of\n",
       "yellow stone; a fisherman’s net hung against the wall to dry, and hard\n",
       "by in the river was his boat; a group of peasant women in bright-colored\n",
       "dresses, crossing the arched bridge, were reflected in the placid\n",
       "stream. Altogether it was an admirable scene for a landscape-painter.\n",
       "\n",
       "The old Moorish mills, so often found on secluded streams, are\n",
       "characteristic objects in Spanish landscape, and suggestive of the\n",
       "perilous times of old. They are of stone, and often in the form of\n",
       "towers with loopholes and battlements, capable of defence in those\n",
       "warlike days when the country on both sides of the border was subject to\n",
       "sudden inroad and hasty ravage, and when men had to labor with their\n",
       "weapons at hand, and some place of temporary refuge.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our next halting-place was at Gandul, where were the remains of another\n",
       "Moorish castle, with its ruined tower, a nestling-place for storks, and\n",
       "commanding a view over a vast campiña or fertile plain, with the\n",
       "mountains of Ronda in the distance. These castles were strongholds to\n",
       "protect the plains from the talas or forays to which they were subject,\n",
       "when the fields of corn would be laid waste, the flocks and herds swept\n",
       "from the vast pastures, and, together with captive peasantry, hurried\n",
       "off in long cavalgadas across the borders.\n",
       "\n",
       "At Gandul we found a tolerable posada; the good folks could not tell us\n",
       "what time of day it was, the clock only struck once in the day, two\n",
       "hours after noon; until that time it was guesswork. We guessed it was\n",
       "full time to eat; so, alighting, we ordered a repast. While that was in\n",
       "preparation, we visited the palace once the residence of the Marquis of\n",
       "Gandul. All was gone to decay; there were but two or three rooms\n",
       "habitable, and very poorly furnished. Yet here were the remains of\n",
       "grandeur: a terrace, where fair dames and gentle cavaliers may once have\n",
       "walked; a fish-pond and ruined garden, with grape-vines and date-bearing\n",
       "palm-trees. Here we were joined by a fat curate, who gathered a bouquet\n",
       "of roses, and presented it, very gallantly, to the lady who accompanied\n",
       "us.\n",
       "\n",
       "Below the palace was the mill, with orange-trees and aloes in front, and\n",
       "a pretty stream of pure water. We took a seat in the shade; and the\n",
       "millers, all leaving their work, sat down and smoked with us; for the\n",
       "Andalusians are always ready for a gossip. They were waiting for the\n",
       "regular visit of the barber, who came once a week to put all their chins\n",
       "in order. He arrived shortly afterwards: a lad of seventeen, mounted on\n",
       "a donkey, eager to display his new alforjas or saddle-bags, just bought\n",
       "at a fair; price one dollar, to be paid on St. John’s day (in June), by\n",
       "which time he trusted to have mown beards enough to put him in funds.\n",
       "\n",
       "By the time the laconic clock of the castle had struck two we had\n",
       "finished our dinner. So, taking leave of our Seville friends, and\n",
       "leaving the millers still under the hands of the barber, we set off on\n",
       "our ride across the campiña. It was one of those vast plains, common in\n",
       "Spain, where for miles and miles there is neither house nor tree.\n",
       "Unlucky the traveller who has to traverse it, exposed as we were to\n",
       "heavy and repeated showers of rain. There is no escape nor shelter. Our\n",
       "only protection was our Spanish cloaks, which nearly covered man and\n",
       "horse, but grew heavier every mile. By the time we had lived through one\n",
       "shower we would see another slowly but inevitably approaching;\n",
       "fortunately in the interval there would be an outbreak of bright, warm,\n",
       "Andalusian sunshine, which would make our cloaks send up wreaths of\n",
       "steam, but which partially dried them before the next drenching.\n",
       "\n",
       "Shortly after sunset we arrived at Arahal, a little town among the\n",
       "hills. We found it in a bustle with a party of miquelets, who were\n",
       "patrolling the country to ferret out robbers. The appearance of\n",
       "foreigners like ourselves was an unusual circumstance in an interior\n",
       "country town; and little Spanish towns of the kind are easily put in a\n",
       "state of gossip and wonderment by such an occurrence. Mine host, with\n",
       "two or three old wiseacre comrades in brown cloaks, studied our\n",
       "passports in a corner of the posada, while an Alguazil took notes by the\n",
       "dim light of a lamp. The passports were in foreign languages and\n",
       "perplexed them, but our squire, Sancho, assisted them in their studies,\n",
       "and magnified our importance with the grandiloquence of a Spaniard. In\n",
       "the mean time the magnificent distribution of a few cigars had won the\n",
       "hearts of all around us; in a little while the whole community seemed\n",
       "put in agitation to make us welcome. The corregidor himself waited upon\n",
       "us, and a great rush-bottomed arm-chair was ostentatiously bolstered\n",
       "into our room by our landlady, for the accommodation of that important\n",
       "personage. The commander of the patrol took supper with us: a lively,\n",
       "talking, laughing Andaluz, who had made a campaign in South America, and\n",
       "recounted his exploits in love and war with much pomp of phrase,\n",
       "vehemence of gesticulation, and mysterious rolling of the eye. He told\n",
       "us that he had a list of all the robbers in the country, and meant to\n",
       "ferret out every mother’s son of them; he offered us at the same time\n",
       "some of his soldiers as an escort. “One is enough to protect you,\n",
       "Señors; the robbers know me, and know my men; the sight of one is enough\n",
       "to spread terror through a whole sierra.” We thanked him for his offer,\n",
       "but assured him, in his own strain, that with the protection of our\n",
       "redoubtable squire, Sancho, we were not afraid of all the ladrones of\n",
       "Andalusia.\n",
       "\n",
       "While we were supping with our drawcansir friend, we heard the notes of\n",
       "a guitar, and the click of castanets, and presently a chorus of voices\n",
       "singing a popular air. In fact, mine host had gathered together the\n",
       "amateur singers and musicians, and the rustic belles of the\n",
       "neighborhood, and, on going forth, the courtyard or patio of the inn\n",
       "presented a scene of true Spanish festivity. We took our seats with mine\n",
       "host and hostess and the commander of the patrol, under an archway\n",
       "opening into the court; the guitar passed from hand to hand, but a\n",
       "jovial shoemaker was the Orpheus of the place. He was a\n",
       "pleasant-looking fellow, with huge black whiskers; his sleeves were\n",
       "rolled up to his elbows. He touched the guitar with masterly skill, and\n",
       "sang a little amorous ditty with an expressive leer at the women, with\n",
       "whom he was evidently a favorite. He afterwards danced a fandango with a\n",
       "buxom Andalusian damsel, to the great delight of the spectators. But\n",
       "none of the females present could compare with mine host’s pretty\n",
       "daughter, Pepita, who had slipped away and made her toilette for the\n",
       "occasion, and had covered her head with roses; and who distinguished\n",
       "herself in a bolero with a handsome young dragoon. We ordered our host\n",
       "to let wine and refreshment circulate freely among the company, yet,\n",
       "though there was a motley assembly of soldiers, muleteers, and\n",
       "villagers, no one exceeded the bounds of sober enjoyment. The scene was\n",
       "a study for a painter: the picturesque group of dancers, the troopers in\n",
       "their half military dresses, the peasantry wrapped in their brown\n",
       "cloaks; nor must I omit to mention the old meagre Alguazil, in a short\n",
       "black cloak, who took no notice of anything going on, but sat in a\n",
       "corner diligently writing by the dim light of a huge copper lamp, that\n",
       "might have figured in the days of Don Quixote.\n",
       "\n",
       "The following morning was bright and balmy, as a May morning ought to\n",
       "be, according to the poets. Leaving Arahal at seven o’clock, with all\n",
       "the posada at the door to cheer us off, we pursued our way through a\n",
       "fertile country, covered with grain and beautifully verdant; but which\n",
       "in summer, when the harvest is over and the fields parched and brown,\n",
       "must be monotonous and lonely; for, as in our ride of yesterday, there\n",
       "were neither houses nor people to be seen. The latter all congregate in\n",
       "villages and strongholds among the hills, as if these fertile plains\n",
       "were still subject to the ravages of the Moor.\n",
       "\n",
       "At noon we came to where there was a group of trees, beside a brook in a\n",
       "rich meadow. Here we alighted to make our mid-day meal. It was really a\n",
       "luxurious spot, among wild flowers and aromatic herbs, with birds\n",
       "singing around us. Knowing the scanty larders of Spanish inns, and the\n",
       "houseless tracts we might have to traverse, we had taken care to have\n",
       "the alforjas of our squire well stocked with cold provisions, and his\n",
       "bota, or leathern bottle, which might hold a gallon, filled to the neck\n",
       "with choice Valdepeñas wine.[2] As we depended more upon these for our\n",
       "well-being than even his trabuco, we exhorted him to be more attentive\n",
       "in keeping them well charged; and I must do him the justice to say that\n",
       "his namesake, the trencher-loving Sancho Panza, was never a more\n",
       "provident purveyor. Though the alforjas and the bota were frequently and\n",
       "vigorously assailed throughout the journey, they had a wonderful power\n",
       "of repletion, our vigilant squire sacking everything that remained from\n",
       "our repasts at the inns, to supply these junketings by the road-side,\n",
       "which were his delight.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the present occasion he spread quite a sumptuous variety of remnants\n",
       "on the greensward before us, graced with an excellent ham brought from\n",
       "Seville; then, taking his seat at a little distance, he solaced himself\n",
       "with what remained in the alforjas. A visit or two to the bota made him\n",
       "as merry and chirruping as a grasshopper filled with dew. On my\n",
       "comparing his contents of the alforjas to Sancho’s skimming of the\n",
       "flesh-pots at the wedding of Cammacho, I found he was well versed in\n",
       "the history of Don Quixote, but, like many of the common people of\n",
       "Spain, firmly believed it to be a true history.\n",
       "\n",
       "“All that happened a long time ago, Señor,” said he, with an inquiring\n",
       "look.\n",
       "\n",
       "“A very long time,” I replied.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I dare say more than a thousand years,”--still looking dubiously.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I dare say not less.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The squire was satisfied. Nothing pleased the simple-hearted varlet more\n",
       "than my comparing him to the renowned Sancho for devotion to the\n",
       "trencher; and he called himself by no other name throughout the journey.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our repast being finished, we spread our cloaks on the greensward under\n",
       "the tree, and took a luxurious siesta in the Spanish fashion. The\n",
       "clouding up of the weather, however, warned us to depart, and a harsh\n",
       "wind sprang up from the southeast. Towards five o’clock we arrived at\n",
       "Osuna, a town of fifteen thousand inhabitants, situated on the side of a\n",
       "hill, with a church and a ruined castle. The posada was outside of the\n",
       "walls; it had a cheerless look. The evening being cold, the inhabitants\n",
       "were crowded round a brasero in a chimney-corner; and the hostess was a\n",
       "dry old woman, who looked like a mummy. Every one eyed us askance as we\n",
       "entered, as Spaniards are apt to regard strangers; a cheery, respectful\n",
       "salutation on our part, caballeroing them and touching our sombreros,\n",
       "set Spanish pride at ease; and when we took our seat among them, lit our\n",
       "cigars, and passed the cigar-box round among them, our victory was\n",
       "complete. I have never known a Spaniard, whatever his rank or condition,\n",
       "who would suffer himself to be outdone in courtesy; and to the common\n",
       "Spaniard the present of a cigar (puro) is irresistible. Care, however,\n",
       "must be taken never to offer him a present with an air of superiority\n",
       "and condescension; he is too much of a caballero to receive favors at\n",
       "the cost of his dignity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Leaving Osuna at an early hour the next morning, we entered the sierra\n",
       "or range of mountains. The road wound through picturesque scenery, but\n",
       "lonely; and a cross here and there by the road-side, the sign of a\n",
       "murder, showed that we were now coming among the “robber haunts.” This\n",
       "wild and intricate country, with its silent plains and valleys\n",
       "intersected by mountains, has ever been famous for banditti. It was here\n",
       "that Omar Ibn Hassan, a robber-chief among the Moslems, held ruthless\n",
       "sway in the ninth century, disputing dominion even with the caliphs of\n",
       "Cordova. This too was a part of the regions so often ravaged during the\n",
       "reign of Ferdinand and Isabella by Ali Atar, the old Moorish alcayde of\n",
       "Loxa, father-in-law of Boabdil, so that it was called Ali Atar’s garden,\n",
       "and here “Jose Maria,” famous in Spanish brigand story, had his favorite\n",
       "lurking-places.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the course of the day we passed through Fuente la Piedra, near a\n",
       "little salt lake of the same name, a beautiful sheet of water,\n",
       "reflecting like a mirror the distant mountains. We now came in sight of\n",
       "Antiquera, that old city of warlike reputation, lying in the lap of the\n",
       "great sierra which runs through Andalusia. A noble Vega spread out\n",
       "before it, a picture of mild fertility set in a frame of rocky\n",
       "mountains. Crossing a gentle river we approached the city between hedges\n",
       "and gardens, in which nightingales were pouring forth their evening\n",
       "song. About nightfall we arrived at the gates. Everything in this\n",
       "venerable city has a decidedly Spanish stamp. It lies too much out of\n",
       "the frequented track of foreign travel to have its old usages trampled\n",
       "out. Here I observed old men still wearing the montero, or ancient\n",
       "hunting-cap, once common throughout Spain; while the young men wore the\n",
       "little round-crowned hat, with brim turned up all round, like a cup\n",
       "turned down in its saucer; while the brim was set off with little black\n",
       "tufts like cockades. The women, too, were all in mantillas and\n",
       "basquinas. The fashions of Paris had not reached Antiquera.\n",
       "\n",
       "Pursuing our course through a spacious street, we put up at the posada\n",
       "of San Fernando. As Antiquera, though a considerable city, is, as I\n",
       "observed, somewhat out of the track of travel, I had anticipated bad\n",
       "quarters and poor fare at the inn. I was agreeably disappointed,\n",
       "therefore, by a supper-table amply supplied, and what were still more\n",
       "acceptable, good clean rooms and comfortable beds. Our man Sancho felt\n",
       "himself as well off as his namesake when he had the run of the duke’s\n",
       "kitchen, and let me know, as I retired for the night, that it had been a\n",
       "proud time for the alforjas.\n",
       "\n",
       "Early in the morning (May 4th) I strolled to the ruins of the old\n",
       "Moorish castle, which itself had been reared on the ruins of a Roman\n",
       "fortress. Here, taking my seat on the remains of a crumbling tower, I\n",
       "enjoyed a grand and varied landscape, beautiful in itself, and full of\n",
       "storied and romantic associations; for I was now in the very heart of\n",
       "the country famous for the chivalrous contests between Moor and\n",
       "Christian. Below me, in its lap of hills, lay the old warrior city so\n",
       "often mentioned in chronicle and ballad. Out of yon gate and down yon\n",
       "hill paraded the band of Spanish cavaliers, of highest rank and bravest\n",
       "bearing, to make that foray during the war and conquest of Granada,\n",
       "which ended in the lamentable massacre among the mountains of Malaga,\n",
       "and laid all Andalusia in mourning. Beyond spread out the Vega, covered\n",
       "with gardens and orchards and fields of grain and enamelled meadows,\n",
       "inferior only to the famous Vega of Granada. To the right the Rock of\n",
       "the Lovers stretched like a cragged promontory into the plain, whence\n",
       "the daughter of the Moorish alcayde and her lover, when closely\n",
       "pursued, threw themselves in despair.\n",
       "\n",
       "The matin peal from church and convent below me rang sweetly in the\n",
       "morning air, as I descended. The market-place was beginning to throng\n",
       "with the populace, who traffic in the abundant produce of the vega; for\n",
       "this is the mart of an agricultural region. In the market-place were\n",
       "abundance of freshly plucked roses for sale; for not a dame or damsel of\n",
       "Andalusia thinks her gala dress complete without a rose shining like a\n",
       "gem among her raven tresses.\n",
       "\n",
       "On returning to the inn I found our man Sancho in high gossip with the\n",
       "landlord and two or three of his hangers-on. He had just been telling\n",
       "some marvellous story about Seville, which mine host seemed piqued to\n",
       "match with one equally marvellous about Antiquera. There was once a\n",
       "fountain, he said, in one of the public squares, called _Il fuente del\n",
       "toro_, (the fountain of the bull,) because the water gushed from the\n",
       "mouth of a bull’s head, carved of stone. Underneath the head was\n",
       "inscribed,--\n",
       "\n",
       "    En frente del toro\n",
       "    Se hallen tesoro.\n",
       "\n",
       "(In front of the bull there is treasure.) Many digged in front of the\n",
       "fountain, but lost their labor and found no money. At last one knowing\n",
       "fellow construed the motto a different way. It is in the forehead\n",
       "(frente) of the bull that the treasure is to be found, said he to\n",
       "himself, and I am the man to find it. Accordingly he came, late at\n",
       "night, with a mallet, and knocked the head to pieces; and what do you\n",
       "think he found?\n",
       "\n",
       "“Plenty of gold and diamonds!” cried Sancho eagerly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He found nothing,” rejoined mine host, dryly, “and he ruined the\n",
       "fountain.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Here a great laugh was set up by the landlord’s hangers-on; who\n",
       "considered Sancho completely taken in by what I presume was one of mine\n",
       "host’s standing jokes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Leaving Antiquera at eight o’clock, we had a delightful ride along the\n",
       "little river, and by gardens and orchards fragrant with the odors of\n",
       "spring and vocal with the nightingale. Our road passed round the Rock of\n",
       "the Lovers (el peñon de los enamorados), which rose in a precipice above\n",
       "us. In the course of the morning we passed through Archidona, situated\n",
       "in the breast of a high hill, with a three-pointed mountain towering\n",
       "above it, and the ruins of a Moorish fortress. It was a great toil to\n",
       "ascend a steep stony street leading up into the city, although it bore\n",
       "the encouraging name of Calle Real del Llano (the royal street of the\n",
       "plain), but it was still a greater toil to descend from this mountain\n",
       "city on the other side.\n",
       "\n",
       "At noon we halted in sight of Archidona, in a pleasant little meadow\n",
       "among hills covered with olive-trees. Our cloaks were spread on the\n",
       "grass, under an elm by the side of a bubbling rivulet; our horses were\n",
       "tethered where they might crop the herbage, and Sancho was told to\n",
       "produce his alforjas. He had been unusually silent this morning ever\n",
       "since the laugh raised at his expense, but now his countenance\n",
       "brightened, and he produced his alforjas with an air of triumph. They\n",
       "contained the contributions of four days’ journeying, but had been\n",
       "signally enriched by the foraging of the previous evening in the\n",
       "plenteous inn at Antiquera; and this seemed to furnish him with a\n",
       "set-off to the banter of mine host.\n",
       "\n",
       "    En frente del toro\n",
       "    Se hallen tesoro\n",
       "\n",
       "would he exclaim, with a chuckling laugh, as he drew forth the\n",
       "heterogeneous contents one by one, in a series which seemed to have no\n",
       "end. First came forth a shoulder of roasted kid, very little the worse\n",
       "for wear; then an entire partridge; then a great morsel of salted\n",
       "codfish wrapped in paper; then the residue of a ham; then the half of a\n",
       "pullet, together with several rolls of bread, and a rabble rout of\n",
       "oranges, figs, raisins, and walnuts. His bota also had been recruited\n",
       "with some excellent wine of Malaga. At every fresh apparition from his\n",
       "larder, he would enjoy our ludicrous surprise, throwing himself back on\n",
       "the grass, shouting with laughter, and exclaiming, “Frente del\n",
       "toro!--frente del toro! Ah, Señors, they thought Sancho a simpleton at\n",
       "Antiquera; but Sancho knew where to find the _tesoro_.”\n",
       "\n",
       "While we were diverting ourselves with his simple drollery, a solitary\n",
       "beggar approached, who had almost the look of a pilgrim. He had a\n",
       "venerable gray beard, and was evidently very old, supporting himself on\n",
       "a staff, yet age had not bowed him down; he was tall and erect, and had\n",
       "the wreck of a fine form. He wore a round Andalusian hat, a sheep-skin\n",
       "jacket, and leathern breeches, gaiters, and sandals. His dress, though\n",
       "old and patched, was decent, his demeanor manly, and he addressed us\n",
       "with the grave courtesy that is to be remarked in the lowest Spaniard.\n",
       "We were in a favorable mood for such a visitor; and in a freak of\n",
       "capricious charity gave him some silver, a loaf of fine wheaten bread,\n",
       "and a goblet of our choice wine of Malaga. He received them thankfully,\n",
       "but without any grovelling tribute of gratitude. Tasting the wine, he\n",
       "held it up to the light, with a slight beam of surprise in his eye; then\n",
       "quaffing it off at a draught, “It is many years,” said he, “since I have\n",
       "tasted such wine. It is a cordial to an old man’s heart.” Then, looking\n",
       "at the beautiful wheaten loaf, “_bendito sea tal pan!_” “blessed be such\n",
       "bread!” So saying, he put it in his wallet. We urged him to eat it on\n",
       "the spot. “No, Señors,” replied he, “the wine I had either to drink or\n",
       "leave; but the bread I may take home to share with my family.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Our man Sancho sought our eye, and reading permission there, gave the\n",
       "old man some of the ample fragments of our repast, on condition,\n",
       "however, that he should sit down and make a meal.\n",
       "\n",
       "He accordingly took his seat at some little distance from us, and began\n",
       "to eat slowly, and with a sobriety and decorum that would have become a\n",
       "hidalgo. There was altogether a measured manner and a quiet\n",
       "self-possession about the old man, that made me think that he had seen\n",
       "better days: his language too, though simple, had occasionally something\n",
       "picturesque and almost poetical in the phraseology. I set him down for\n",
       "some broken-down cavalier. I was mistaken; it was nothing but the innate\n",
       "courtesy of a Spaniard, and the poetical turn of thought and language\n",
       "often to be found in the lowest classes of this clear-witted people. For\n",
       "fifty years, he told us, he had been a shepherd, but now he was out of\n",
       "employ and destitute. “When I was a young man,” said he, “nothing could\n",
       "harm or trouble me; I was always well, always gay; but now I am\n",
       "seventy-nine years of age, and a beggar, and my heart begins to fail\n",
       "me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Still he was not a regular mendicant: it was not until recently that\n",
       "want had driven him to this degradation; and he gave a touching picture\n",
       "of the struggle between hunger and pride, when abject destitution first\n",
       "came upon him. He was returning from Malaga without money; he had not\n",
       "tasted food for some time, and was crossing one of the great plains of\n",
       "Spain, where there were but few habitations. When almost dead with\n",
       "hunger, he applied at the door of a venta or country inn. “_Perdón usted\n",
       "por Dios hermano!_” (Excuse us, brother, for God’s sake!) was the\n",
       "reply--the usual mode in Spain of refusing a beggar. “I turned away,”\n",
       "said he, “with shame greater than my hunger, for my heart was yet too\n",
       "proud. I came to a river with high banks, and deep, rapid current, and\n",
       "felt tempted to throw myself in: ‘What should such an old, worthless,\n",
       "wretched man as I live for?’ But when I was on the brink of the current,\n",
       "I thought on the blessed Virgin, and turned away. I travelled on until I\n",
       "saw a country-seat at a little distance from the road, and entered the\n",
       "outer gate of the court-yard. The door was shut, but there were two\n",
       "young señoras at a window. I approached and begged;--‘_Perdón usted por\n",
       "Dios hermano!_’--and the window closed. I crept out of the court-yard,\n",
       "but hunger overcame me, and my heart gave way: I thought my hour at\n",
       "hand, so I laid myself down at the gate, commended myself to the Holy\n",
       "Virgin, and covered my head to die. In a little while afterwards the\n",
       "master of the house came home: seeing me lying at his gate, he uncovered\n",
       "my head, had pity on my gray hairs, took me into his house, and gave me\n",
       "food. So, Señors, you see that one should always put confidence in the\n",
       "protection of the Virgin.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The old man was on his way to his native place, Archidona, which was in\n",
       "full view on its steep and rugged mountain. He pointed to the ruins of\n",
       "its castle. “That castle,” he said, “was inhabited by a Moorish king at\n",
       "the time of the wars of Granada. Queen Isabella invaded it with a great\n",
       "army; but the king looked down from his castle among the clouds, and\n",

       "guided her and her army up a mysterious path in the mountains, which had\n",
       "never before been known. When the Moor saw her coming, he was\n",
       "astonished, and springing with his horse from a precipice, was dashed to\n",
       "pieces! The marks of his horse’s hoofs,” said the old man, “are to be\n",
       "seen in the margin of the rock to this day. And see, Señors, yonder is\n",
       "the road by which the queen and her army mounted: you see it like a\n",
       "ribbon up the mountain’s side; but the miracle is, that, though it can\n",
       "be seen at a distance, when you come near it disappears!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The ideal road to which he pointed was undoubtedly a sandy ravine of the\n",
       "mountain, which looked narrow and defined at a distance, but became\n",
       "broad and indistinct on an approach.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the old man’s heart warmed with wine and wassail, he went on to tell\n",
       "us a story of the buried treasure left under the castle by the Moorish\n",
       "king. His own house was next to the foundations of the castle. The\n",
       "curate and notary dreamed three times of the treasure, and went to work\n",
       "at the place pointed out in their dreams. His own son-in-law heard the\n",
       "sound of their pickaxes and spades at night. What they found, nobody\n",
       "knows; they became suddenly rich, but kept their own secret. Thus the\n",
       "old man had once been next door to fortune, but was doomed never to get\n",
       "under the same roof.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have remarked that the stories of treasure buried by the Moors, so\n",
       "popular throughout Spain, are most current among the poorest people.\n",
       "Kind nature consoles with shadows for the lack of substantials. The\n",
       "thirsty man dreams of fountains and running streams; the hungry man of\n",
       "banquets; and the poor man of heaps of hidden gold: nothing certainly is\n",
       "more opulent than the imagination of a beggar.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our afternoon’s ride took us through a steep and rugged defile of the\n",
       "mountains, called Puerte del Rey, the Pass of the King; being one of the\n",
       "great passes into the territories of Granada, and the one by which King\n",
       "Ferdinand conducted his army. Towards sunset the road, winding round a\n",
       "hill, brought us in sight of the famous little frontier city of Loxa,\n",
       "which repulsed Ferdinand from its walls. Its Arabic name implies\n",
       "guardian, and such it was to the Vega of Granada, being one of its\n",
       "advanced guards. It was the stronghold of that fiery veteran, old Ali\n",
       "Atar, father-in-law of Boabdil; and here it was that the latter\n",
       "collected his troops, and sallied forth on that disastrous foray which\n",
       "ended in the death of the old alcayde and his own captivity. From its\n",
       "commanding position at the gate, as it were, of this mountain-pass, Loxa\n",
       "has not unaptly been termed the key of Granada. It is wildly\n",
       "picturesque; built along the face of an arid mountain. The ruins of a\n",
       "Moorish alcazar or citadel crown a rocky mound which rises out of the\n",
       "centre of the town. The river Xenil washes its base, winding among\n",
       "rocks, and groves, and gardens, and meadows, and crossed by a Moorish\n",
       "bridge. Above the city all is savage and sterile, below is the richest\n",
       "vegetation and the freshest verdure. A similar contrast is presented by\n",
       "the river: above the bridge it is placid and grassy, reflecting groves\n",
       "and gardens; below it is rapid, noisy, and tumultuous. The Sierra\n",
       "Nevada, the royal mountains of Granada, crowned with perpetual snow,\n",
       "form the distant boundary to this varied landscape, one of the most\n",
       "characteristic of romantic Spain.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alighting at the entrance of the city, we gave our horses to Sancho to\n",
       "lead them to the inn, while we strolled about to enjoy the singular\n",
       "beauty of the environs. As we crossed the bridge to a fine alameda, or\n",
       "public walk, the bells tolled the hour of orison. At the sound the\n",
       "wayfarers, whether on business or pleasure, paused, took off their hats,\n",
       "crossed themselves, and repeated their evening prayer: a pious custom\n",
       "still rigidly observed in retired parts of Spain. Altogether it was a\n",
       "solemn and beautiful evening scene, and we wandered on as the evening\n",
       "gradually closed, and the new moon began to glitter between the high\n",
       "elms of the alameda. We were roused from this quiet state of enjoyment\n",
       "by the voice of our trusty squire hailing us from a distance. He came up\n",
       "to us, out of breath. “Ah, Señores,” cried he, “el pobre Sancho no es\n",
       "nada sin Don Quixote.” (Ah, Señors, poor Sancho is nothing without Don\n",
       "Quixote.) He had been alarmed at our not coming to the inn; Loxa was\n",
       "such a wild mountain place, full of contrabandistas, enchanters, and\n",
       "infiernos; he did not well know what might have happened, and set out to\n",
       "seek us, inquiring after us of every person he met, until he traced us\n",
       "across the bridge, and, to his great joy, caught sight of us strolling\n",
       "in the alameda.\n",
       "\n",
       "The inn to which he conducted us was called the Corona, or Crown, and we\n",
       "found it quite in keeping with the character of the place, the\n",
       "inhabitants of which seem still to retain the bold, fiery spirit of the\n",
       "olden time. The hostess was a young and handsome Andalusian widow, whose\n",
       "trim basquiña of black silk, fringed with bugles, set off the play of a\n",
       "graceful form and round pliant limbs. Her step was firm and elastic; her\n",
       "dark eye was full of fire; and the coquetry of her air, and varied\n",
       "ornaments of her person, showed that she was accustomed to be admired.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was well matched by a brother, nearly about her own age; they were\n",
       "perfect models of the Andalusian Majo and Maja. He was tall, vigorous,\n",
       "and well-formed, with a clear olive complexion, a dark beaming eye, and\n",
       "curling chestnut whiskers that met under his chin. He was gallantly\n",
       "dressed in a short green velvet jacket, fitted to his shape, profusely\n",
       "decorated with silver buttons, with a white handkerchief in each pocket.\n",
       "He had breeches of the same, with rows of buttons from the hips to the\n",
       "knees; a pink silk handkerchief round his neck, gathered through a ring,\n",
       "on the bosom of a neatly plaited shirt; a sash round the waist to match;\n",
       "bottinas, or spatter-dashes, of the finest russet leather, elegantly\n",
       "worked, and open at the calf to show his stocking; and russet shoes,\n",
       "setting off a well-shaped foot.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he was standing at the door, a horseman rode up and entered into low\n",
       "and earnest conversation with him. He was dressed in a similar style,\n",
       "and almost with equal finery; a man about thirty, square-built, with\n",
       "strong Roman features, handsome, though slightly pitted with the\n",
       "small-pox; with a free, bold, and somewhat daring air. His powerful\n",
       "black horse was decorated with tassels and fanciful trappings, and a\n",
       "couple of broad-mouthed blunderbusses hung behind the saddle. He had the\n",
       "air of one of those contrabandistas I have seen in the mountains of\n",
       "Ronda, and evidently had a good understanding with the brother of mine\n",
       "hostess; nay, if I mistake not, he was a favored admirer of the widow.\n",
       "In fact, the whole inn and its inmates had something of a contrabandista\n",
       "aspect, and a blunderbuss stood in a corner beside the guitar. The\n",
       "horseman I have mentioned passed his evening in the posada, and sang\n",
       "several bold mountain romances with great spirit. As we were at supper,\n",
       "two poor Asturians put in in distress, begging food and a night’s\n",
       "lodging. They had been waylaid by robbers as they came from a fair among\n",
       "the mountains, robbed of a horse which carried all their stock in trade,\n",
       "stripped of their money, and most of their apparel, beaten for having\n",
       "offered resistance, and left almost naked in the road. My companion,\n",
       "with a prompt generosity natural to him, ordered them a supper and a\n",
       "bed, and gave them a sum of money to help them forward towards their\n",
       "home.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the evening advanced, the _dramatis personæ_ thickened. A large man,\n",
       "about sixty years of age, of powerful frame, came strolling in, to\n",
       "gossip with mine hostess. He was dressed in the ordinary Andalusian\n",
       "costume, but had a huge sabre tucked under his arm; wore large\n",
       "moustaches, and had something of a lofty swaggering air. Every one\n",
       "seemed to regard him with great deference.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our man Sancho whispered to us that he was Don Ventura Rodriguez, the\n",
       "hero and champion of Loxa, famous for his prowess and the strength of\n",
       "his arm. In the time of the French invasion he surprised six troopers\n",
       "who were asleep; he first secured their horses, then attacked them with\n",
       "his sabre, killed some, and took the rest prisoners. For this exploit\n",
       "the king allows him a peseta (the fifth of a duro, or dollar) per day\n",
       "and has dignified him with the title of Don.\n",
       "\n",
       "I was amused to behold his swelling language and demeanor. He was\n",
       "evidently a thorough Andalusian, boastful as brave. His sabre was always\n",
       "in his hand or under his arm. He carries it always about with him as a\n",
       "child does its doll, calls it his Santa Teresa, and says, “When I draw\n",
       "it, the earth trembles” (tiembla la tierra).\n",
       "\n",
       "I sat until a late hour listening to the varied themes of this motley\n",
       "group, who mingled together with the unreserve of a Spanish posada. We\n",
       "had contrabandista songs, stories of robbers, guerrilla exploits, and\n",
       "Moorish legends. The last were from our handsome landlady, who gave a\n",
       "poetical account of the infiernos, or infernal regions of Loxa,--dark\n",
       "caverns, in which subterranean streams and waterfalls make a mysterious\n",
       "sound. The common people say that there are money-coiners shut up there\n",
       "from the time of the Moors; and that the Moorish kings kept their\n",
       "treasures in those caverns.\n",
       "\n",
       "I retired to bed with my imagination excited by all that I had seen and\n",
       "heard in this old warrior city. Scarce had I fallen asleep when I was\n",
       "aroused by a horrid din and uproar, that might have confounded the hero\n",
       "of La Mancha himself, whose experience of Spanish inns was a continual\n",
       "uproar. It seemed for a moment as if the Moors were once more breaking\n",
       "into the town; or the infiernos of which mine hostess talked had broken\n",
       "loose. I sallied forth, half dressed, to reconnoitre. It was nothing\n",
       "more nor less than a charivari to celebrate the nuptials of an old man\n",
       "with a buxom damsel. Wishing him joy of his bride and his serenade, I\n",
       "returned to my more quiet bed, and slept soundly until morning.\n",
       "\n",
       "While dressing, I amused myself in reconnoitring the populace from my\n",
       "window. There were groups of fine-looking young men in the trim fanciful\n",
       "Andalusian costume, with brown cloaks, thrown about them in true Spanish\n",
       "style, which cannot be imitated, and little round majo hats stuck on\n",
       "with a peculiar knowing air. They had the same galliard look which I\n",
       "have remarked among the dandy mountaineers of Ronda. Indeed, all this\n",
       "part of Andalusia abounds with such game-looking characters. They loiter\n",
       "about the towns and villages; seem to have plenty of time and plenty of\n",
       "money; “horse to ride and weapon to wear.” Great gossips, great smokers,\n",
       "apt at touching the guitar, singing couplets to their maja belles, and\n",
       "famous dancers of the bolero. Throughout all Spain the men, however\n",
       "poor, have a gentlemanlike abundance of leisure; seeming to consider it\n",
       "the attribute of a true cavaliero never to be in a hurry; but the\n",
       "Andalusians are gay as well as leisurely, and have none of the squalid\n",
       "accompaniments of idleness. The adventurous contraband trade which\n",
       "prevails throughout these mountain regions, and along the maritime\n",
       "borders of Andalusia, is doubtless at the bottom of this galliard\n",
       "character.\n",
       "\n",
       "In contrast to the costume of these groups was that of two long-legged\n",
       "Valencians conducting a donkey, laden with articles of merchandise;\n",
       "their musket slung crosswise over his back, ready for action. They wore\n",
       "round jackets (jalecos), wide linen bragas or drawers scarce reaching to\n",
       "the knees and looking like kilts, red fajas or sashes swathed tightly\n",
       "round their waists, sandals of espartal or bass weed, colored kerchiefs\n",
       "round their heads somewhat in the style of turbans, but leaving the top\n",
       "of the head uncovered; in short, their whole appearance having much of\n",
       "the traditional Moorish stamp.\n",
       "\n",
       "On leaving Loxa we were joined by a cavalier, well-mounted and\n",
       "well-armed, and followed on foot by an escopetero or musketeer. He\n",
       "saluted us courteously, and soon let us into his quality. He was chief\n",
       "of the customs, or rather, I should suppose, chief of an armed company\n",
       "whose business it is to patrol the roads and look out for\n",
       "contrabandistas. The escopetero was one of his guards. In the course of\n",
       "our morning’s ride I drew from him some particulars concerning the\n",
       "smugglers, who have risen to be a kind of mongrel chivalry in Spain.\n",
       "They come into Andalusia, he said, from various parts, but especially\n",
       "from La Mancha; sometimes to receive goods, to be smuggled on an\n",
       "appointed night across the line at the plaza or strand of Gibraltar;\n",
       "sometimes to meet a vessel, which is to hover on a given night off a\n",
       "certain part of the coast. They keep together and travel in the night.\n",
       "In the daytime they lie quiet in barrancos, gullies of the mountains, or\n",
       "lonely farm-houses; where they are generally well received, as they make\n",
       "the family liberal presents of their smuggled wares. Indeed, much of the\n",
       "finery and trinkets worn by the wives and daughters of the mountain\n",
       "hamlets and farm-houses are presents from the gay and open-handed\n",
       "contrabandistas.\n",
       "\n",
       "Arrived at the part of the coast where a vessel is to meet them, they\n",
       "look out at night from some rocky point or headland. If they descry a\n",
       "sail near the shore they make a concerted signal; sometimes it consists\n",
       "in suddenly displaying a lantern three times from beneath the folds of a\n",
       "cloak. If the signal is answered, they descend to the shore and prepare\n",
       "for quick work. The vessel runs close in; all her boats are busy landing\n",
       "the smuggled goods, made up into snug packages for transportation on\n",
       "horseback. These are hastily thrown on the beach, as hastily gathered\n",
       "up and packed on the horses, and then the contrabandistas clatter off to\n",
       "the mountains. They travel by the roughest, wildest, and most solitary\n",
       "roads, where it is almost fruitless to pursue them. The custom-house\n",
       "guards do not attempt it: they take a different course. When they hear\n",
       "of one of these bands returning full freighted through the mountains,\n",
       "they go out in force, sometimes twelve infantry and eight horsemen, and\n",
       "take their station where the mountain defile opens into the plain. The\n",
       "infantry, who lie in ambush some distance within the defile, suffer the\n",
       "band to pass, then rise and fire upon them. The contrabandistas dash\n",
       "forward, but are met in front by the horsemen. A wild skirmish ensues.\n",
       "The contrabandistas, if hard pressed, become desperate. Some dismount,\n",
       "use their horses as breastworks, and fire over their backs; others cut\n",
       "the cords, let the packs fall off to delay the enemy, and endeavor to\n",
       "escape with their steeds. Some get off in this way with the loss of\n",
       "their packages; some are taken, horses, packages, and all; others\n",
       "abandon everything, and make their escape by scrambling up the\n",
       "mountains. “And then,” cried Sancho, who had been listening with a\n",
       "greedy ear, “_se hacen ladrones legítimos_,”--and then they become\n",
       "legitimate robbers.\n",
       "\n",
       "I could not help laughing at Sancho’s idea of a legitimate calling of\n",
       "the kind; but the chief of customs told me it was really the case that\n",
       "the smugglers, when thus reduced to extremity, thought they had a kind\n",
       "of right to take the road, and lay travellers under contribution, until\n",
       "they had collected funds enough to mount and equip themselves in\n",
       "contrabandista style.\n",
       "\n",
       "Towards noon our wayfaring companion took leave of us and turned up a\n",
       "steep defile, followed by his escopetero; and shortly afterwards we\n",
       "emerged from the mountains, and entered upon the far-famed Vega of\n",
       "Granada.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our last mid-day’s repast was taken under a grove of olive-trees on the\n",
       "border of a rivulet. We were in a classical neighborhood; for not far\n",
       "off were the groves and orchards of the Soto de Roma. This, according to\n",
       "fabulous tradition, was a retreat founded by Count Julian to console his\n",
       "daughter Florinda. It was a rural resort of the Moorish kings of\n",
       "Granada; and has in modern times been granted to the Duke of Wellington.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our worthy squire made a half melancholy face as he drew forth, for the\n",
       "last time, the contents of his alforjas, lamenting that our expedition\n",
       "was drawing to a close, for, with such cavaliers, he said, he could\n",
       "travel to the world’s end. Our repast, however, was a gay one; made\n",
       "under such delightful auspices. The day was without a cloud. The heat of\n",
       "the sun was tempered by cool breezes from the mountains. Before us\n",
       "extended the glorious Vega. In the distance was romantic Granada\n",
       "surmounted by the ruddy towers of the Alhambra, while far above it the\n",
       "snowy summits of the Sierra Nevada shone like silver.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our repast finished, we spread our cloaks and took our last siesta _al\n",
       "fresco_, lulled by the humming of bees among the flowers and the notes\n",
       "of doves among the olive-trees. When the sultry hours were passed we\n",
       "resumed our journey. After a time we overtook a pursy little man shaped\n",
       "not unlike a toad and mounted on a mule. He fell into conversation with\n",
       "Sancho, and finding we were strangers, undertook to guide us to a good\n",
       "posada. He was an escribano (notary), he said, and knew the city as\n",
       "thoroughly as his own pocket. “Ah Dios, Señores! what a city you are\n",
       "going to see. Such streets! such squares! such palaces! and then the\n",
       "women--ah Santa Maria purísima--what women!”--“But the posada you talk\n",
       "of,” said I, “are you sure it is a good one?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Good! Santa Maria! the best in Granada. Salones grandes--camas de\n",
       "luxo--colchones de pluma (grand saloons--luxurious sleeping-rooms--beds\n",
       "of down). Ah, Señores, you will fare like King Chico in the Alhambra.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And how will my horses fare?” cried Sancho.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Like King Chico’s horses. _Chocolate con leche y bollos para almuerza_”\n",
       "(chocolate and milk with sugar cakes for breakfast), giving the squire a\n",
       "knowing wink and a leer.\n",
       "\n",
       "After such satisfactory accounts, nothing more was to be desired on that\n",
       "head. So we rode quietly on, the squab little notary taking the lead,\n",
       "and turning to us every moment with some fresh exclamation about the\n",
       "grandeurs of Granada and the famous times we were to have at the posada.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus escorted, we passed between hedges of aloes and Indian figs, and\n",
       "through that wilderness of gardens with which the Vega is embroidered,\n",
       "and arrived about sunset at the gates of the city. Our officious little\n",
       "conductor conveyed us up one street and down another, until he rode into\n",
       "the court-yard of an inn where he appeared to be perfectly at home.\n",
       "Summoning the landlord by his Christian name, he committed us to his\n",
       "care as two cavalleros de mucho valor, worthy of his best apartments and\n",
       "most sumptuous fare. We were instantly reminded of the patronizing\n",
       "stranger who introduced Gil Blas with such a flourish of trumpets to the\n",
       "host and hostess of the inn at Pennaflor, ordering trouts for his supper\n",
       "and eating voraciously at his expense. “You know not what you possess,”\n",
       "cried he to the innkeeper and his wife. “You have a treasure in your\n",
       "house. Behold in this young gentleman the eighth wonder of the\n",
       "world--nothing in this house is too good for Señor Gil Blas of\n",
       "Santillane, who deserves to be entertained like a prince.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Determined that the little notary should not eat trouts at our expense,\n",
       "like his prototype of Pennaflor, we forbore to ask him to supper; nor\n",
       "had we reason to reproach ourselves with ingratitude, for we found\n",
       "before morning the little varlet, who was no doubt a good friend of the\n",

       "How many legends and traditions, true and fabulous,--how many songs and\n",
       "ballads, Arabian and Spanish, of love and war and chivalry, are\n",
       "associated with this Oriental pile! It was the royal abode of the\n",
       "Moorish kings, where, surrounded with the splendors and refinements of\n",
       "Asiatic luxury, they held dominion over what they vaunted as a\n",
       "terrestrial paradise, and made their last stand for empire in Spain. The\n",
       "royal palace forms but a part of a fortress, the walls of which, studded\n",
       "with towers, stretch irregularly round the whole crest of a hill, a spur\n",
       "of the Sierra Nevada or Snowy Mountains, and overlook the city;\n",
       "externally it is a rude congregation of towers and battlements, with no\n",
       "regularity of plan nor grace of architecture, and giving little promise\n",
       "of the grace and beauty which prevail within.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the time of the Moors the fortress was capable of containing within\n",
       "its outward precincts an army of forty thousand men, and served\n",
       "occasionally as a stronghold of the sovereigns against their rebellious\n",
       "subjects. After the kingdom had passed into the hands of the Christians,\n",
       "the Alhambra continued to be a royal demesne, and was occasionally\n",
       "inhabited by the Castilian monarchs. The emperor Charles V. commenced a\n",
       "sumptuous palace within its walls, but was deterred from completing it\n",
       "by repeated shocks of earthquakes. The last royal residents were Philip\n",
       "V. and his beautiful queen, Elizabetta of Parma, early in the eighteenth\n",
       "century. Great preparations were made for their reception. The palace\n",
       "and gardens were placed in a state of repair, and a new suite of\n",
       "apartments erected, and decorated by artists brought from Italy. The\n",
       "sojourn of the sovereigns was transient, and after their departure the\n",
       "palace once more became desolate. Still the place was maintained with\n",
       "some military state. The governor held it immediately from the crown,\n",
       "its jurisdiction extended down into the suburbs of the city, and was\n",
       "independent of the captain-general of Granada. A considerable garrison\n",
       "was kept up; the governor had his apartments in the front of the old\n",
       "Moorish palace, and never descended into Granada without some military\n",
       "parade. The fortress, in fact, was a little town of itself, having\n",
       "several streets of houses within its walls, together with a Franciscan\n",
       "convent and a parochial church.\n",
       "\n",
       "The desertion of the court, however, was a fatal blow to the Alhambra.\n",
       "Its beautiful halls became desolate, and some of them fell to ruin; the\n",
       "gardens were destroyed, and the fountains ceased to play. By degrees the\n",
       "dwellings became filled with a loose and lawless population;\n",
       "contrabandistas, who availed themselves of its independent jurisdiction\n",
       "to carry on a wide and daring course of smuggling, and thieves and\n",
       "rogues of all sorts, who made this their place of refuge whence they\n",
       "might depredate upon Granada and its vicinity. The strong arm of\n",
       "government at length interfered; the whole community was thoroughly\n",
       "sifted; none were suffered to remain but such as were of honest\n",
       "character, and had legitimate right to a residence; the greater part of\n",
       "the houses were demolished and a mere hamlet left, with the parochial\n",
       "church and the Franciscan convent. During the recent troubles in Spain,\n",
       "when Granada was in the hands of the French, the Alhambra was garrisoned\n",
       "by their troops, and the palace was occasionally inhabited by the French\n",
       "commander. With that enlightened taste which has ever distinguished the\n",
       "French nation in their conquests, this monument of Moorish elegance and\n",
       "grandeur was rescued from the absolute ruin and desolation that were\n",
       "overwhelming it. The roofs were repaired, the saloons and galleries\n",
       "protected from the weather, the gardens cultivated, the watercourses\n",
       "restored, the fountains once more made to throw up their sparkling\n",
       "showers; and Spain may thank her invaders for having preserved to her\n",
       "the most beautiful and interesting of her historical monuments.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the departure of the French they blew up several towers of the outer\n",
       "wall, and left the fortifications scarcely tenable. Since that time the\n",
       "military importance of the post is at an end. The garrison is a handful\n",
       "of invalid soldiers, whose principal duty is to guard some of the outer\n",
       "towers, which serve occasionally as a prison of state; and the governor,\n",
       "abandoning the lofty hill of the Alhambra, resides in the centre of\n",
       "Granada, for the more convenient dispatch of his official duties. I\n",
       "cannot conclude this brief notice of the state of the fortress without\n",
       "bearing testimony to the honorable exertions of its present commander,\n",
       "Don Francisco de Serna, who is tasking all the limited resources at his\n",
       "command to put the palace in a state of repair, and by his judicious\n",
       "precautions has for some time arrested its too certain decay. Had his\n",
       "predecessors discharged the duties of their station with equal fidelity,\n",
       "the Alhambra might yet have remained in almost its pristine beauty; were\n",
       "government to second him with means equal to his zeal, this relic of it\n",
       "might still be preserved for many generations to adorn the land, and\n",
       "attract the curious and enlightened of every clime.\n",
       "\n",
       "Our first object of course, on the morning after our arrival, was a\n",
       "visit to this time-honored edifice; it has been so often, however, and\n",
       "so minutely described by travellers, that I shall not undertake to give\n",
       "a comprehensive and elaborate account of it, but merely occasional\n",
       "sketches of parts, with the incidents and associations connected with\n",
       "them.\n",

       "Leaving our posada, and traversing the renowned square of the\n",
       "Vivarrambla, once the scene of Moorish jousts and tournaments, now a\n",
       "crowded market-place, we proceeded along the Zacatin, the main street of\n",
       "what, in the time of the Moors, was the Great Bazaar, and where small\n",
       "shops and narrow alleys still retain the Oriental character. Crossing an\n",
       "open place in front of the palace of the captain-general, we ascended a\n",
       "confined and winding street, the name of which reminded us of the\n",
       "chivalric days of Granada. It is called the Calle, or street of the\n",
       "Gomeres, from a Moorish family famous in chronicle and song. This street\n",
       "led up to the Puerta de las Granadas, a massive gateway of Grecian\n",

       "tall, meagre varlet, whose rusty-brown cloak was evidently intended to\n",
       "conceal the ragged state of his nether garments, was lounging in the\n",
       "sunshine and gossiping with an ancient sentinel on duty. He joined us as\n",
       "we entered the gate, and offered his services to show us the fortress.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have a traveller’s dislike to officious ciceroni, and did not\n",

       "The common Spaniards have certainly a most poetical way of expressing\n",
       "themselves. “A son of the Alhambra!” the appellation caught me at once;\n",
       "the very tattered garb of my new acquaintance assumed a dignity in my\n",

       "I put some further questions to him, and found that his title was\n",
       "legitimate. His family had lived in the fortress from generation to\n",
       "generation ever since the time of the Conquest. His name was Mateo\n",
       "Ximenes. “Then, perhaps,” said I, “you may be a descendant from the\n",
       "great Cardinal Ximenes?”--“Dios Sabe! God knows, Señor! It may be so. We\n",
       "are the oldest family in the Alhambra,--_Christianos Viejos_, old\n",
       "Christians, without any taint of Moor or Jew. I know we belong to some\n",
       "great family or other, but I forget whom. My father knows all about it:\n",
       "he has the coat of arms hanging up in his cottage, up in the fortress.”\n",
       "There is not any Spaniard, however poor, but has some claim to high\n",
       "pedigree. The first title of this ragged worthy, however, had completely\n",
       "captivated me; so I gladly accepted the services of the “son of the\n",
       "Alhambra.”\n",
       "\n",
       "We now found ourselves in a deep narrow ravine, filled with beautiful\n",
       "groves, with a steep avenue, and various footpaths winding through it,\n",
       "bordered with stone seats, and ornamented with fountains. To our left we\n",
       "beheld the towers of the Alhambra beetling above us; to our right, on\n",
       "the opposite side of the ravine, we were equally dominated by rival\n",
       "towers on a rocky eminence. These, we were told, were the Torres\n",
       "Vermejos, or vermilion towers, so called from their ruddy hue. No one\n",
       "knows their origin. They are of a date much anterior to the Alhambra;\n",
       "some suppose them to have been built by the Romans; others, by some\n",
       "wandering colony of Phœnicians. Ascending the steep and shady avenue,\n",
       "we arrived at the foot of a huge square Moorish tower, forming a kind of\n",
       "barbican, through which passed the main entrance to the fortress. Within\n",
       "the barbican was another group of veteran invalids, one mounting guard\n",
       "at the portal, while the rest, wrapped in their tattered cloaks, slept\n",
       "on the stone benches. This portal is called the Gate of Justice, from\n",
       "the tribunal held within its porch during the Moslem domination, for the\n",
       "immediate trial of petty causes: a custom common to the Oriental\n",
       "nations, and occasionally alluded to in the Sacred Scriptures. “Judges\n",

       "\n",
       "The great vestibule, or porch of the gate, is formed by an immense\n",
       "Arabian arch, of the horseshoe form, which springs to half the height of\n",
       "the tower. On the keystone of this arch is engraven a gigantic hand.\n",
       "Within the vestibule, on the keystone of the portal, is sculptured, in\n",
       "like manner, a gigantic key. Those who pretend to some knowledge of\n",
       "Mohammedan symbols, affirm that the hand is the emblem of doctrine, the\n",
       "five fingers designating the five principal commandments of the creed of\n",
       "Islam, fasting, pilgrimage, alms-giving, ablution, and war against\n",
       "infidels. The key, say they, is the emblem of the faith or of power; the\n",
       "key of Daoud, or David, transmitted to the prophet. “And the key of the\n",
       "house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open and none\n",
       "shall shut, and he shall shut and none shall open.” (Isaiah xxii. 22.)\n",
       "The key we are told was emblazoned on the standard of the Moslems in\n",
       "opposition to the Christian emblem of the cross, when they subdued Spain\n",
       "or Andalusia. It betokened the conquering power invested in the prophet.\n",
       "“He that hath the key of David, he that openeth and no man shutteth;\n",
       "and shutteth and no man openeth.” (Rev. iii. 7.)\n",
       "\n",
       "A different explanation of these emblems, however, was given by the\n",
       "legitimate son of the Alhambra, and one more in unison with the notions\n",
       "of the common people, who attach something of mystery and magic to\n",
       "everything Moorish, and have all kinds of superstitions connected with\n",
       "this old Moslem fortress. According to Mateo, it was a tradition handed\n",
       "down from the oldest inhabitants, and which he had from his father and\n",
       "grandfather, that the hand and key were magical devices on which the\n",
       "fate of the Alhambra depended. The Moorish king who built it was a great\n",
       "magician, or, as some believed, had sold himself to the devil, and had\n",
       "laid the whole fortress under a magic spell. By this means it had\n",
       "remained standing for several years, in defiance of storms and\n",
       "earthquakes, while almost all other buildings of the Moors had fallen to\n",
       "ruin and disappeared. This spell, the tradition went on to say, would\n",
       "last until the hand on the outer arch should reach down and grasp the\n",
       "key, when the whole pile would tumble to pieces, and all the treasures\n",
       "buried beneath it by the Moors would be revealed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Notwithstanding this ominous prediction, we ventured to pass through the\n",
       "spell-bound gateway, feeling some little assurance against magic art in\n",
       "the protection of the Virgin, a statue of whom we observed above the\n",
       "portal.\n",
       "\n",
       "After passing through the barbican, we ascended a narrow lane, winding\n",
       "between walls, and came on an open esplanade within the fortress, called\n",
       "the Plaza de los Algibes, or Place of the Cisterns, from great\n",
       "reservoirs which undermine it, cut in the living rock by the Moors to\n",
       "receive the water brought by conduits from the Darro, for the supply of\n",
       "the fortress. Here, also, is a well of immense depth, furnishing the\n",
       "purest and coldest of water,--another monument of the delicate taste of\n",
       "the Moors, who were indefatigable in their exertions to obtain that\n",
       "element in its crystal purity.\n",
       "\n",
       "In front of this esplanade is the splendid pile commenced by Charles V.,\n",
       "and intended, it is said, to eclipse the residence of the Moorish kings.\n",
       "Much of the Oriental edifice intended for the winter season was\n",
       "demolished to make way for this massive pile. The grand entrance was\n",
       "blocked up; so that the present entrance to the Moorish palace is\n",
       "through a simple and almost humble portal in a corner. With all the\n",
       "massive grandeur and architectural merit of the palace of Charles V., we\n",
       "regarded it as an arrogant intruder, and passing by it with a feeling\n",
       "almost of scorn, rang at the Moslem portal.\n",
       "\n",
       "While waiting for admittance, our self-imposed cicerone, Mateo Ximenes,\n",
       "informed us that the royal palace was intrusted to the care of a worthy\n",
       "old maiden dame called Doña Antonia-Molina, but who, according to\n",
       "Spanish custom, went by the more neighborly appellation of Tia Antonia\n",
       "(Aunt Antonia), who maintained the Moorish halls and gardens in order\n",
       "and showed them to strangers. While we were talking, the door was opened\n",
       "by a plump little black-eyed Andalusian damsel, whom Mateo addressed as\n",
       "Dolores, but who from her bright looks and cheerful disposition\n",
       "evidently merited a merrier name. Mateo informed me in a whisper that\n",
       "she was the niece of Tia Antonia, and I found she was the good fairy who\n",
       "was to conduct us through the enchanted palace. Under her guidance we\n",
       "crossed the threshold, and were at once transported, as if by magic\n",
       "wand, into other times and an Oriental realm, and were treading the\n",
       "scenes of Arabian story. Nothing could be in greater contrast than the\n",
       "unpromising exterior of the pile with the scene now before us. We found\n",
       "ourselves in a vast patio or court, one hundred and fifty feet in\n",
       "length, and upwards of eighty feet in breadth, paved with white marble,\n",
       "and decorated at each end with light Moorish peristyles, one of which\n",
       "supported an elegant gallery of fretted architecture. Along the\n",
       "mouldings of the cornices and on various parts of the walls were\n",
       "escutcheons and ciphers, and cufic and Arabic characters in high relief,\n",
       "repeating the pious mottoes of the Moslem monarchs, the builders of the\n",
       "Alhambra, or extolling their grandeur and munificence. Along the centre\n",
       "of the court extended an immense basin or tank (estanque), a hundred and\n",
       "twenty-four feet in length, twenty-seven in breadth, and five in depth,\n",
       "receiving its water from two marble vases. Hence it is called the Court\n",
       "of the Alberca (from al Beerkah, the Arabic for a pond or tank). Great\n",
       "numbers of gold-fish were to be seen gleaming through the waters of the\n",
       "basin, and it was bordered by hedges of roses.\n",
       "\n",
       "Passing from the Court of the Alberca under a Moorish archway, we\n",
       "entered the renowned Court of Lions. No part of the edifice gives a more\n",
       "complete idea of its original beauty than this, for none has suffered so\n",
       "little from the ravages of time. In the centre stands the fountain\n",
       "famous in song and story. The alabaster basins still shed their diamond\n",
       "drops; the twelve lions which support them, and give the court its name,\n",
       "still cast forth crystal streams as in the days of Boabdil. The lions,\n",
       "however, are unworthy of their fame, being of miserable sculpture, the\n",
       "work probably of some Christian captive. The court is laid out in\n",
       "flower-beds, instead of its ancient and appropriate pavement of tiles or\n",
       "marble; the alteration, an instance of bad taste, was made by the French\n",
       "when in possession of Granada. Round the four sides of the court are\n",
       "light Arabian arcades of open filigree work, supported by slender\n",
       "pillars of white marble, which it is supposed were originally gilded.\n",
       "The architecture, like that in most parts of the interior of the palace,\n",
       "is characterized by elegance rather than grandeur, bespeaking a\n",
       "delicate and graceful taste, and a disposition to indolent enjoyment.\n",
       "When one looks upon the fairy traces of the peristyles, and the\n",
       "apparently fragile fretwork of the walls, it is difficult to believe\n",
       "that so much has survived the wear and tear of centuries, the shocks of\n",
       "earthquakes, the violence of war, and the quiet, though no less baneful,\n",
       "pilferings of the tasteful traveller: it is almost sufficient to excuse\n",
       "the popular tradition, that the whole is protected by a magic charm.\n",
       "\n",
       "On one side of the court a rich portal opens into the Hall of the\n",
       "Abencerrages: so called from the gallant cavaliers of that illustrious\n",
       "line who were here perfidiously massacred. There are some who doubt the\n",
       "whole story, but our humble cicerone Mateo pointed out the very wicket\n",
       "of the portal through which they were introduced one by one into the\n",
       "Court of Lions, and the white marble fountain in the centre of the hall\n",
       "beside which they were beheaded. He showed us also certain broad ruddy\n",
       "stains on the pavement, traces of their blood, which, according to\n",
       "popular belief, can never be effaced.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finding we listened to him apparently with easy faith, he added, that\n",
       "there was often heard at night, in the Court of Lions, a low confused\n",
       "sound, resembling the murmuring of a multitude; and now and then a faint\n",
       "tinkling, like the distant clank of chains. These sounds were made by\n",
       "the spirits of the murdered Abencerrages; who nightly haunt the scene of\n",
       "their suffering and invoke the vengeance of Heaven on their destroyer.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sounds in question had no doubt been produced, as I had afterwards\n",
       "an opportunity of ascertaining, by the bubbling currents and tinkling\n",
       "falls of water conducted under the pavement through pipes and channels\n",
       "to supply the fountains; but I was too considerate to intimate such an\n",
       "idea to the humble chronicler of the Alhambra.\n",
       "\n",
       "Encouraged by my easy credulity, Mateo gave me the following as an\n",
       "undoubted fact, which he had from his grandfather:--\n",
       "\n",
       "There was once an invalid soldier, who had charge of the Alhambra to\n",
       "show it to strangers; as he was one evening, about twilight, passing\n",
       "through the Court of Lions, he heard footsteps on the Hall of the\n",
       "Abencerrages; supposing some strangers to be lingering there, he\n",
       "advanced to attend upon them, when to his astonishment he beheld four\n",
       "Moors richly dressed, with gilded cuirasses and cimeters, and poniards\n",
       "glittering with precious stones. They were walking to and fro, with\n",
       "solemn pace; but paused and beckoned to him. The old soldier, however,\n",
       "took to flight, and could never afterwards be prevailed upon to enter\n",
       "the Alhambra. Thus it is that men sometimes turn their backs upon\n",
       "fortune; for it is the firm opinion of Mateo, that the Moors intended to\n",
       "reveal the place where their treasures lay buried. A successor to the\n",
       "invalid soldier was more knowing; he came to the Alhambra poor; but at\n",
       "the end of a year went off to Malaga, bought houses, set up a carriage,\n",
       "and still lives there, one of the richest as well as oldest men of the\n",
       "place; all which, Mateo sagely surmised, was in consequence of his\n",
       "finding out the golden secret of these phantom Moors.\n",
       "\n",
       "I now perceived I had made an invaluable acquaintance in this son of the\n",
       "Alhambra, one who knew all the apocryphal history of the place, and\n",
       "firmly believed in it, and whose memory was stuffed with a kind of\n",
       "knowledge for which I have a lurking fancy, but which is too apt to be\n",
       "considered rubbish by less indulgent philosophers. I determined to\n",
       "cultivate the acquaintance of this learned Theban.\n",
       "\n",
       "Immediately opposite the Hall of the Abencerrages, a portal, richly\n",
       "adorned, leads into a hall of less tragical associations. It is light\n",
       "and lofty, exquisitely graceful in its architecture, paved with white\n",
       "marble, and bears the suggestive name of the Hall of the Two Sisters.\n",
       "Some destroy the romance of the name by attributing it to two enormous\n",
       "slabs of alabaster which lie side by side, and form a great part of the\n",
       "pavement: an opinion strongly supported by Mateo Ximenes. Others are\n",

       "     This mode of diapering walls with arabesques, and stuccoing the\n",
       "     vaults with grotto-work, was invented in Damascus, but highly\n",
       "     improved by the Moors in Morocco, to whom Saracenic architecture\n",
       "     owes its most graceful and fanciful details. The process by which\n",
       "     all this fairy tracery was produced was ingeniously simple. The\n",
       "     wall in its naked state was divided off by lines crossing at right\n",

       "ALHAMAR, THE FOUNDER OF THE ALHAMBRA\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The Moors of Granada regarded the Alhambra as a miracle of art, and had\n",
       "a tradition that the king who founded it dealt in magic, or at least in\n",
       "alchemy, by means whereof he procured the immense sums of gold expended\n",
       "in its erection. A brief view of his reign will show the secret of his\n",
       "wealth. He is known in Arabian history as Muhamed Ibn-l-Ahmar; but his\n",
       "name in general is written simply Alhamar, and was given to him, we are\n",
       "told, on account of his ruddy complexion.[5]\n",
       "\n",
       "He was of the noble and opulent line of the Beni Nasar, or tribe of\n",
       "Nasar, and was born in Arjona, in the year of the Hegira 592 (A.D.\n",
       "1195). At his birth the astrologers, we are told, cast his horoscope\n",
       "according to Oriental custom, and pronounced it highly auspicious; and a\n",
       "santon predicted for him a glorious career. No expense was spared in\n",
       "fitting him for the high destinies prognosticated. Before he attained\n",
       "the full years of manhood, the famous battle of the Navas (or plains) of\n",
       "Tolosa shattered the Moorish empire, and eventually severed the Moslems\n",
       "of Spain from the Moslems of Africa. Factions soon arose among the\n",
       "former, headed by warlike chiefs ambitious of grasping the sovereignty\n",
       "of the Peninsula. Alhamar became engaged in these wars; he was the\n",
       "general and leader of the Beni Nasar, and, as such, he opposed and\n",
       "thwarted the ambition of Aben Hud, who had raised his standard among\n",
       "the warlike mountains of the Alpuxaras, and been proclaimed king of\n",
       "Murcia and Granada. Many conflicts took place between these warring\n",
       "chieftains; Alhamar dispossessed his rival of several important places,\n",
       "and was proclaimed king of Jaen by his soldiery; but he aspired to the\n",
       "sovereignty of the whole of Andalusia, for he was of a sanguine spirit\n",
       "and lofty ambition. His valor and generosity went hand in hand; what he\n",
       "gained by the one he secured by the other; and at the death of Aben Hud\n",
       "(A.D. 1238) he became sovereign of all the territories which owed\n",
       "allegiance to that powerful chief. He made his formal entry into Granada\n",
       "in the same year, amid the enthusiastic shouts of the multitude, who\n",
       "hailed him as the only one capable of uniting the various factions which\n",
       "prevailed, and which threatened to lay the empire at the mercy of the\n",
       "Christian princes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alhamar established his court in Granada; he was the first of the\n",
       "illustrious line of Nasar that sat upon a throne. He took immediate\n",
       "measures to put his little kingdom in a posture of defence against the\n",
       "assaults to be expected from his Christian neighbors, repairing and\n",
       "strengthening the frontier posts and fortifying the capital. Not content\n",
       "with the provisions of the Moslem law, by which every man is made a\n",
       "soldier, he raised a regular army to garrison his strongholds, allowing\n",
       "every soldier stationed on the frontier a portion of land for the\n",
       "support of himself, his horse, and his family,--thus interesting him in\n",
       "the defence of the soil in which he had a property. These wise\n",
       "precautions were justified by events. The Christians, profiting by the\n",
       "dismemberment of the Moslem power, were rapidly regaining their ancient\n",
       "territories. James the Conqueror had subjected all Valencia, and\n",
       "Ferdinand the Saint sat down in person before Jaen, the bulwark of\n",
       "Granada. Alhamar ventured to oppose him in open field, but met with a\n",
       "signal defeat, and retired discomfited to his capital. Jaen still held\n",
       "out, and kept the enemy at bay during an entire winter, but Ferdinand\n",
       "swore not to raise his camp until he had gained possession of the place.\n",
       "Alhamar found it impossible to throw reinforcements into the besieged\n",
       "city; he saw that its fall must be followed by the investment of his\n",
       "capital, and was conscious of the insufficiency of his means to cope\n",
       "with the potent sovereign of Castile. Taking a sudden resolution,\n",
       "therefore, he repaired privately to the Christian camp, made his\n",
       "unexpected appearance in the presence of King Ferdinand, and frankly\n",
       "announced himself as the king of Granada. “I come,” said he, “confiding\n",
       "in your good faith, to put myself under your protection. Take all I\n",
       "possess and receive me as your vassal”; so saying, he knelt and kissed\n",
       "the king’s hand in token of allegiance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ferdinand was won by this instance of confiding faith, and determined\n",
       "not to be outdone in generosity. He raised his late enemy from the\n",
       "earth, embraced him as a friend, and, refusing the wealth he offered,\n",
       "left him sovereign of his dominions, under the feudal tenure of a yearly\n",
       "tribute, attendance at the Cortes as one of the nobles of the empire,\n",
       "and service in war with a certain number of horsemen. He moreover\n",
       "conferred on him the honor of knighthood, and armed him with his own\n",
       "hands.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not long after this that Alhamar was called upon for his military\n",
       "services, to aid King Ferdinand in his famous siege of Seville. The\n",
       "Moorish king sallied forth with five hundred chosen horsemen of Granada,\n",
       "than whom none in the world knew better how to manage the steed or wield\n",
       "the lance. It was a humiliating service, however, for they had to draw\n",
       "the sword against their brethren of the faith.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alhamar gained a melancholy distinction by his prowess in this renowned\n",
       "conquest, but more true honor by the humanity which he prevailed upon\n",
       "Ferdinand to introduce into the usages of war. When in 1248 the famous\n",
       "city of Seville surrendered to the Castilian monarch, Alhamar returned\n",
       "sad and full of care to his dominions. He saw the gathering ills that\n",
       "menaced the Moslem cause; and uttered an ejaculation often used by him\n",
       "in moments of anxiety and trouble,--“How straitened and wretched would\n",
       "be our life, if our hope were not so spacious and extensive.” “Que\n",
       "angoste y miserabile seria nuestra vida, sino fuera tan dilatada y\n",
       "espaciosa nuestra esperanza!”\n",
       "\n",
       "As he approached Granada on his return he beheld arches of triumph which\n",
       "had been erected in honor of his martial exploits. The people thronged\n",
       "forth to see him with impatient joy, for his benignant rule had won all\n",
       "hearts. Wherever he passed he was hailed with acclamations as “El\n",
       "Ghalib!” (the conqueror). Alhamar gave a melancholy shake of the head on\n",
       "hearing the appellation. “_Wa le ghalib ile Aláh!_” (there is no\n",
       "conqueror but God) exclaimed he. From that time forward this exclamation\n",
       "became his motto, and the motto of his descendants, and appears to this\n",
       "day emblazoned on his escutcheons in the halls of the Alhambra.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alhamar had purchased peace by submission to the Christian yoke; but he\n",
       "was conscious that, with elements so discordant and motives for\n",
       "hostility so deep and ancient, it could not be permanent. Acting,\n",
       "therefore, upon the old maxim, “Arm thyself in peace and clothe thyself\n",
       "in summer,” he improved the present interval of tranquillity by\n",
       "fortifying his dominions, replenishing his arsenals, and promoting those\n",
       "useful arts which give wealth and real power. He confided the command of\n",
       "his various cities to such as had distinguished themselves by valor and\n",
       "prudence, and who seemed most acceptable to the people. He organized a\n",
       "vigilant police, and established rigid rules for the administration of\n",
       "justice. The poor and the distressed always found ready admission to his\n",
       "presence, and he attended personally to their assistance and redress. He\n",
       "erected hospitals for the blind, the aged, and infirm, and all those\n",
       "incapable of labor, and visited them frequently; not on set days with\n",
       "pomp and form, so as to give time for everything to be put in order, and\n",
       "every abuse concealed, but suddenly, and unexpectedly, informing\n",
       "himself, by actual observation and close inquiry, of the treatment of\n",
       "the sick, and the conduct of those appointed to administer to their\n",
       "relief. He founded schools and colleges, which he visited in the same\n",
       "manner, inspecting personally the instruction of the youth. He\n",
       "established butcheries and public ovens, that the people might be\n",
       "furnished with wholesome provisions at just and regular prices. He\n",
       "introduced abundant streams of water into the city, erecting baths and\n",
       "fountains, and constructing aqueducts and canals to irrigate and\n",
       "fertilize the Vega. By these means prosperity and abundance prevailed in\n",
       "this beautiful city; its gates were thronged with commerce, and its\n",
       "warehouses filled with luxuries and merchandise of every clime and\n",
       "country.\n",
       "\n",
       "He moreover gave premiums and privileges to the best artisans; improved\n",
       "the breed of horses and other domestic animals; encouraged husbandry;\n",
       "and increased the natural fertility of the soil twofold by his\n",
       "protection, making the lovely valleys of his kingdom to bloom like\n",
       "gardens. He fostered also the growth and fabrication of silk, until the\n",
       "looms of Granada surpassed even those of Syria in the fineness and\n",
       "beauty of their productions. He moreover caused the mines of gold and\n",
       "silver and other metals, found in the mountainous regions of his\n",
       "dominions, to be diligently worked, and was the first king of Granada\n",
       "who struck money of gold and silver with his name, taking great care\n",
       "that the coins should be skilfully executed.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was towards the middle of the thirteenth century, and just after his\n",
       "return from the siege of Seville, that he commenced the splendid palace\n",
       "of the Alhambra; superintending the building of it in person; mingling\n",
       "frequently among the artists and workmen, and directing their labors.\n",
       "\n",
       "Though thus magnificent in his works and great in his enterprises, he\n",
       "was simple in his person and moderate in his enjoyments. His dress was\n",
       "not merely void of splendor, but so plain as not to distinguish him from\n",
       "his subjects. His harem boasted but few beauties, and these he visited\n",
       "but seldom, though they were entertained with great magnificence. His\n",
       "wives were daughters of the principal nobles, and were treated by him as\n",
       "friends and rational companions. What is more, he managed to make them\n",
       "live in friendship with one another. He passed much of his time in his\n",
       "gardens; especially in those of the Alhambra, which he had stored with\n",
       "the rarest plants and the most beautiful and aromatic flowers. Here he\n",
       "delighted himself in reading histories, or in causing them to be read\n",
       "and related to him, and sometimes, in intervals of leisure, employed\n",
       "himself in the instruction of his three sons, for whom he had provided\n",
       "the most learned and virtuous masters.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he had frankly and voluntarily offered himself a tributary vassal to\n",
       "Ferdinand, so he always remained loyal to his word, giving him repeated\n",
       "proofs of fidelity and attachment. When that renowned monarch died in\n",
       "Seville in 1254, Alhamar sent ambassadors to condole with his successor,\n",
       "Alonzo X., and with them a gallant train of a hundred Moorish cavaliers\n",
       "of distinguished rank, who were to attend round the royal bier during\n",
       "the funeral ceremonies, each bearing a lighted taper. This grand\n",
       "testimonial of respect was repeated by the Moslem monarch during the\n",
       "remainder of his life on each anniversary of the death of King\n",
       "Ferdinand el Santo, when the hundred Moorish knights repaired from\n",
       "Granada to Seville, and took their stations with lighted tapers in the\n",

       "deceased.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alhamar retained his faculties and vigor to an advanced age. In his\n",
       "seventy-ninth year (A.D. 1272) he took the field on horseback,\n",
       "accompanied by the flower of his chivalry, to resist an invasion of his\n",
       "territories. As the army sallied forth from Granada, one of the\n",
       "principal adalides, or guides, who rode in the advance, accidentally\n",
       "broke his lance against the arch of the gate. The counsellors of the\n",
       "king, alarmed by this circumstance, which was considered an evil omen,\n",
       "entreated him to return. Their supplications were in vain. The king\n",
       "persisted, and at noontide the omen, say the Moorish chroniclers, was\n",
       "fatally fulfilled. Alhamar was suddenly struck with illness, and had\n",
       "nearly fallen from his horse. He was placed on a litter, and borne back\n",
       "towards Granada, but his illness increased to such a degree that they\n",
       "were obliged to pitch his tent in the Vega. His physicians were filled\n",
       "with consternation, not knowing what remedy to prescribe. In a few hours\n",
       "he died, vomiting blood and in violent convulsions. The Castilian\n",
       "prince, Don Philip, brother of Alonzo X., was by his side when he\n",
       "expired. His body was embalmed, enclosed in a silver coffin, and buried\n",
       "in the Alhambra in a sepulchre of precious marble, amidst the unfeigned\n",
       "lamentations of his subjects, who bewailed him as a parent.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have said that he was the first of the illustrious line of Nasar that\n",

       "rallying-place of Moslem power and splendor in the Peninsula. Though his\n",
       "undertakings were vast, and his expenditures immense, yet his treasury\n",
       "was always full; and this seeming contradiction gave rise to the story\n",
       "that he was versed in magic art, and possessed of the secret for\n",
       "transmuting baser metals into gold. Those who have attended to his\n",

       "To the foregoing particulars, concerning the Moslem princes who once\n",

       "completed and embellished the Alhambra. Yusef Abul Hagig (or, as it is\n",
       "sometimes written, Haxis) was another prince of the noble line of Nasar.\n",
       "He ascended the throne of Granada in the year of grace 1333, and is\n",
       "described by Moslem writers as having a noble presence, great bodily\n",
       "strength, and a fair complexion; and the majesty of his countenance\n",
       "increased, say they, by suffering his beard to grow to a dignified\n",
       "length and dyeing it black. His manners were gentle, affable, and\n",
       "urbane; he carried the benignity of his nature into warfare, prohibiting\n",
       "all wanton cruelty, and enjoining mercy and protection towards women and\n",
       "children, the aged and infirm, and all friars and other persons of holy\n",
       "and recluse life. But though he possessed the courage common to generous\n",
       "spirits, the bent of his genius was more for peace than war, and though\n",
       "repeatedly obliged by circumstances to take up arms, he was generally\n",
       "unfortunate.\n",
       "\n",
       "Among other ill-starred enterprises, he undertook a great campaign, in\n",
       "conjunction with the king of Morocco, against the kings of Castile and\n",
       "Portugal, but was defeated in the memorable battle of Salado, which had\n",
       "nearly proved a death-blow to the Moslem power in Spain.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yusef obtained a long truce after this defeat, and now his character\n",
       "shone forth in its true lustre. He had an excellent memory, and had\n",
       "stored his mind with science and erudition; his taste was altogether\n",
       "elegant and refined, and he was accounted the best poet of his time.\n",
       "Devoting himself to the instruction of his people and the improvement of\n",
       "their morals and manners, he established schools in all the villages,\n",
       "with simple and uniform systems of education; he obliged every hamlet of\n",
       "more than twelve houses to have a mosque, and purified the ceremonies of\n",
       "religion, and the festivals and popular amusements, from various abuses\n",
       "and indecorums which had crept into them. He attended vigilantly to the\n",
       "police of the city, establishing nocturnal guards and patrols, and\n",
       "superintending all municipal concerns. His attention was also directed\n",
       "towards finishing the great architectural works commenced by his\n",
       "predecessors, and erecting others on his own plans. The Alhambra, which\n",
       "had been founded by the good Alhamar, was now completed. Yusef\n",
       "constructed the beautiful Gate of Justice, forming the grand entrance to\n",
       "the fortress, which he finished in 1348. He likewise adorned many of the\n",
       "courts and halls of the palace, as may be seen by the inscriptions on\n",
       "the walls, in which his name repeatedly occurs. He built also the noble\n",
       "Alcazar or citadel of Malaga, now unfortunately a mere mass of crumbling\n",
       "ruins, but which most probably exhibited in its interior similar\n",
       "elegance and magnificence with the Alhambra.\n",
       "\n",
       "The genius of a sovereign stamps a character upon his time. The nobles\n",
       "of Granada, imitating the elegant and graceful taste of Yusef, soon\n",
       "filled the city of Granada with magnificent palaces; the halls of which\n",
       "were paved with mosaic, the walls and ceilings wrought in fretwork, and\n",
       "delicately gilded and painted with azure, vermilion, and other brilliant\n",
       "colors, or minutely inlaid with cedar and other precious woods;\n",
       "specimens of which have survived, in all their lustre, the lapse of\n",
       "several centuries. Many of the houses had fountains, which threw up jets\n",
       "of water to refresh and cool the air. They had lofty towers also, of\n",
       "wood or stone, curiously carved and ornamented, and covered with plates\n",
       "of metal that glittered in the sun. Such was the refined and delicate\n",
       "taste in architecture that prevailed among this elegant people; insomuch\n",
       "that, to use the beautiful simile of an Arabian writer, “Granada, in the\n",
       "days of Yusef, was as a silver vase filled with emeralds and jacinths.”\n",
       "\n",
       "One anecdote will be sufficient to show the magnanimity of this generous\n",
       "prince. The long truce which had succeeded the battle of Salado was at\n",
       "an end, and every effort of Yusef to renew it was in vain. His deadly\n",
       "foe, Alfonso XI. of Castile, took the field with great force, and laid\n",
       "siege to Gibraltar. Yusef reluctantly took up arms, and sent troops to\n",
       "the relief of the place. In the midst of his anxiety, he received\n",
       "tidings that his dreaded foe had suddenly fallen a victim to the plague.\n",
       "Instead of manifesting exultation on the occasion, Yusef called to mind\n",
       "the great qualities of the deceased, and was touched with a noble\n",
       "sorrow. “Alas!” cried he, “the world has lost one of its most excellent\n",
       "princes; a sovereign who knew how to honor merit, whether in friend or\n",
       "foe!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The Spanish chroniclers themselves bear witness to this magnanimity.\n",
       "According to their accounts, the Moorish cavaliers partook of the\n",
       "sentiment of their king, and put on mourning for the death of Alfonzo.\n",
       "Even those of Gibraltar, who had been so closely invested, when they\n",
       "knew that the hostile monarch lay dead in his camp, determined among\n",
       "themselves that no hostile movement should be made against the\n",
       "Christians. The day on which the camp was broken up, and the army\n",
       "departed, bearing the corpse of Alfonzo, the Moors issued in multitudes\n",
       "from Gibraltar, and stood mute and melancholy, watching the mournful\n",
       "pageant. The same reverence for the deceased was observed by all the\n",
       "Moorish commanders on the frontiers, who suffered the funeral train to\n",

       "THE MYSTERIOUS CHAMBERS\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "As I was rambling one day about the Moorish halls, my attention was, for\n",
       "the first time, attracted to a door in a remote gallery, communicating\n",
       "apparently with some part of the Alhambra which I had not yet explored.\n",
       "I attempted to open it, but it was locked. I knocked, but no one\n",
       "answered, and the sound seemed to reverberate through empty chambers.\n",
       "Here then was a mystery. Here was the haunted wing of the castle. How\n",
       "was I to get at the dark secrets here shut up from the public eye?\n",
       "Should I come privately at night with lamp and sword, according to the\n",
       "prying custom of heroes of romance; or should I endeavor to draw the\n",
       "secret from Pépe the stuttering gardener; or the ingenuous Dolores, or\n",
       "the loquacious Mateo? Or should I go frankly and openly to Dame Antonia\n",
       "the chatelaine, and ask her all about it? I chose the latter course, as\n",
       "being the simplest though the least romantic; and found, somewhat to my\n",
       "disappointment, that there was no mystery in the case. I was welcome to\n",
       "explore the apartment, and there was the key.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus provided, I returned forthwith to the door. It opened, as I had\n",
       "surmised, to a range of vacant chambers; but they were quite different\n",
       "from the rest of the palace. The architecture, though rich and\n",
       "antiquated, was European. There was nothing Moorish about it. The first\n",
       "two rooms were lofty; the ceilings, broken in many places, were of\n",
       "cedar, deeply panelled and skilfully carved with fruits and flowers,\n",
       "intermingled with grotesque masks or faces.\n",
       "\n",
       "The walls had evidently in ancient times been hung with damask; but now\n",
       "were naked, and scrawled over by that class of aspiring travellers who\n",
       "defile noble monuments with their worthless names. The windows,\n",
       "dismantled and open to wind and weather, looked out into a charming\n",
       "little secluded garden, where an alabaster fountain sparkled among roses\n",
       "and myrtles, and was surrounded by orange and citron trees, some of\n",
       "which flung their branches into the chambers. Beyond these rooms were\n",
       "two saloons, longer but less lofty, looking also into the garden. In the\n",
       "compartments of the panelled ceilings were baskets of fruit and garlands\n",
       "of flowers, painted by no mean hand, and in tolerable preservation. The\n",
       "walls also had been painted in fresco in the Italian style, but the\n",
       "paintings were nearly obliterated; the windows were in the same\n",
       "shattered state with those of the other chambers. This fanciful suite of\n",
       "rooms terminated in an open gallery with balustrades, running at right\n",
       "angles along another side of the garden. The whole apartment, so\n",
       "delicate and elegant in its decorations, so choice and sequestered in\n",
       "its situation along this retired little garden, and so different in\n",
       "architecture from the neighboring halls, awakened an interest in its\n",
       "history. I found on inquiry that it was an apartment fitted up by\n",
       "Italian artists in the early part of the last century, at the time when\n",
       "Philip V. and his second wife, the beautiful Elizabetta of Farnese,\n",
       "daughter of the Duke of Parma, were expected at the Alhambra. It was\n",
       "destined for the queen and the ladies of her train. One of the loftiest\n",
       "chambers had been her sleeping-room. A narrow staircase, now walled up,\n",
       "led up to a delightful belvidere, originally a mirador of the Moorish\n",
       "sultanas, communicating with the harem; but which was fitted up as a\n",
       "boudoir for the fair Elizabetta, and still retains the name of _el\n",
       "tocador de la Reyna_, or the queen’s toilette.\n",
       "\n",
       "One window of the royal sleeping-room commanded a prospect of the\n",
       "Generalife and its embowered terraces; another looked out into the\n",
       "little secluded garden I have mentioned, which was decidedly Moorish in\n",
       "its character, and also had its history. It was in fact the garden of\n",
       "Lindaraxa, so often mentioned in descriptions of the Alhambra; but who\n",
       "this Lindaraxa was I had never heard explained. A little research gave\n",
       "me the few particulars known about her. She was a Moorish beauty who\n",
       "flourished in the court of Muhamed the Left-Handed, and was the daughter\n",
       "of his loyal adherent, the alcayde of Malaga, who sheltered him in his\n",
       "city when driven from the throne. On regaining his crown, the alcayde\n",
       "was rewarded for his fidelity. His daughter had her apartment in the\n",
       "Alhambra, and was given by the king in marriage to Nasar, a young\n",
       "Cetimerien prince descended from Aben Hud the Just. Their espousals were\n",
       "doubtless celebrated in the royal palace, and their honeymoon may have\n",
       "passed among these very bowers.[7]\n",
       "\n",
       "Four centuries had elapsed since the fair Lindaraxa passed away, yet how\n",
       "much of the fragile beauty of the scenes she inhabited remained! The\n",
       "garden still bloomed in which she delighted; the fountain still\n",
       "presented the crystal mirror in which her charms may once have been\n",
       "reflected; the alabaster, it is true, had lost its whiteness; the basin\n",
       "beneath, overrun with weeds, had become the lurking-place of the\n",
       "lizard, but there was something in the very decay that enhanced the\n",
       "interest of the scene, speaking as it did of that mutability, the\n",
       "irrevocable lot of man and all his works.\n",
       "\n",
       "The desolation too of these chambers, once the abode of the proud and\n",
       "elegant Elizabetta, had a more touching charm for me than if I had\n",
       "beheld them in their pristine splendor, glittering with the pageantry of\n",
       "a court.\n",
       "\n",
       "When I returned to my quarters, in the governor’s apartment, everything\n",
       "seemed tame and commonplace after the poetic region I had left. The\n",
       "thought suggested itself: Why could I not change my quarters to these\n",
       "vacant chambers? that would indeed be living in the Alhambra, surrounded\n",
       "by its gardens and fountains, as in the time of the Moorish sovereigns.\n",
       "I proposed the change to Dame Antonia and her family, and it occasioned\n",
       "vast surprise. They could not conceive any rational inducement for the\n",
       "choice of an apartment so forlorn, remote, and solitary. Dolores\n",
       "exclaimed at its frightful loneliness; nothing but bats and owls\n",
       "flitting about,--and then a fox and wildcat kept in the vaults of the\n",
       "neighboring baths, and roamed about at night. The good Tia had more\n",
       "reasonable objections. The neighborhood was infested by vagrants;\n",
       "gypsies swarmed in the caverns of the adjacent hills; the palace was\n",
       "ruinous and easy to be entered in many places; the rumor of a stranger\n",
       "quartered alone in one of the remote and ruined apartments, out of the\n",
       "hearing of the rest of the inhabitants, might tempt unwelcome visitors\n",
       "in the night, especially as foreigners were always supposed to be well\n",
       "stocked with money. I was not to be diverted from my humor, however, and\n",
       "my will was law with these good people. So, calling in the assistance of\n",
       "a carpenter, and the over officious Mateo Ximenes, the doors and windows\n",
       "were soon placed in a state of tolerable security, and the\n",
       "sleeping-room of the stately Elizabetta prepared for my reception. Mateo\n",
       "kindly volunteered as a body-guard to sleep in my antechamber; but I did\n",
       "not think it worth while to put his valor to the proof.\n",
       "\n",
       "With all the hardihood I had assumed and all the precautions I had\n",
       "taken, I must confess the first night passed in these quarters was\n",
       "inexpressibly dreary. I do not think it was so much the apprehension of\n",
       "dangers from without that affected me, as the character of the place\n",
       "itself, with all its strange associations: the deeds of violence\n",
       "committed there; the tragical ends of many of those who had once reigned\n",
       "there in splendor. As I passed beneath the fated halls of the Tower of\n",
       "Comares on the way to my chamber, I called to mind a quotation, that\n",
       "used to thrill me in the days of boyhood:\n",
       "\n",
       "    Fate sits on these dark battlements and frowns;\n",
       "    And, as the portal opens to receive me,\n",
       "    A voice in sullen echoes through the courts\n",
       "    Tells of a nameless deed!\n",
       "\n",
       "The whole family escorted me to my chamber, and took leave of me as of\n",
       "one engaged on a perilous enterprise; and when I heard their retreating\n",
       "steps die away along the waste antechambers and echoing galleries, and\n",
       "turned the key of my door, I was reminded of those hobgoblin stories,\n",
       "where the hero is left to accomplish the adventure of an enchanted\n",
       "house.\n",
       "\n",
       "Even the thoughts of the fair Elizabetta and the beauties of her court,\n",
       "who had once graced these chambers, now, by a perversion of fancy, added\n",
       "to the gloom. Here was the scene of their transient gayety and\n",
       "loveliness; here were the very traces of their elegance and enjoyment;\n",
       "but what and where were they? Dust and ashes! tenants of the tomb!\n",
       "phantoms of the memory!\n",
       "\n",
       "A vague and indescribable awe was creeping over me. I would fain have\n",
       "ascribed it to the thoughts of robbers awakened by the evening’s\n",
       "conversation, but I felt it was something more unreal and absurd. The\n",
       "long-buried superstitions of the nursery were reviving, and asserting\n",
       "their power over my imagination. Everything began to be affected by the\n",
       "working of my mind. The whispering of the wind among the citron-trees\n",
       "beneath my window had something sinister. I cast my eyes into the garden\n",
       "of Lindaraxa; the groves presented a gulf of shadows; the thickets,\n",
       "indistinct and ghastly shapes. I was glad to close the window, but my\n",
       "chamber itself became infected. There was a slight rustling noise\n",
       "overhead; a bat suddenly emerged from a broken panel of the ceiling,\n",
       "flitting about the room and athwart my solitary lamp; and as the fateful\n",
       "bird almost flouted my face with his noiseless wing, the grotesque faces\n",
       "carved in high relief in the cedar ceiling, whence he had emerged,\n",
       "seemed to mope and mow at me.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rousing myself, and half smiling at this temporary weakness, I resolved\n",
       "to brave it out in the true spirit of the hero of the enchanted house;\n",
       "so, taking lamp in hand, I sallied forth to make a tour of the palace.\n",
       "Notwithstanding every mental exertion the task was a severe one. I had\n",
       "to traverse waste halls and mysterious galleries, where the rays of the\n",
       "lamp extended but a short distance around me. I walked, as it were, in a\n",
       "mere halo of light, walled in by impenetrable darkness. The vaulted\n",
       "corridors were as caverns; the ceilings of the halls were lost in gloom.\n",
       "I recalled all that had been said of the danger from interlopers in\n",
       "these remote and ruined apartments. Might not some vagrant foe be\n",
       "lurking before or behind me, in the outer darkness? My own shadow, cast\n",
       "upon the wall, began to disturb me. The echoes of my own footsteps along\n",
       "the corridors made me pause and look round. I was traversing scenes\n",
       "fraught with dismal recollections. One dark passage led down to the\n",
       "mosque where Yusef, the Moorish monarch, the finisher of the Alhambra,\n",
       "had been basely murdered. In another place I trod the gallery where\n",
       "another monarch had been struck down by the poniard of a relative whom\n",
       "he had thwarted in his love.\n",
       "\n",
       "A low murmuring sound, as of stifled voices and clanking chains, now\n",
       "reached me. It seemed to come from the Hall of the Abencerrages. I knew\n",
       "it to be the rush of water through subterranean channels, but it sounded\n",
       "strangely in the night, and reminded me of the dismal stories to which\n",
       "it had given rise.\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon, however, my ear was assailed by sounds too fearfully real to be\n",
       "the work of fancy. As I was crossing the Hall of Ambassadors, low moans\n",
       "and broken ejaculations rose, as it were, from beneath my feet. I paused\n",
       "and listened. They then appeared to be outside of the tower--then again\n",
       "within. Then broke forth howlings as of an animal--then stifled shrieks\n",
       "and inarticulate ravings. Heard in that dead hour and singular place,\n",
       "the effect was thrilling. I had no desire for further perambulation; but\n",
       "returned to my chamber with infinitely more alacrity than I had sallied\n",
       "forth, and drew my breath more freely when once more within its walls\n",
       "and the door bolted behind me. When I awoke in the morning, with the sun\n",
       "shining in at my window and lighting up every part of the building with\n",
       "his cheerful and truth-telling beams, I could scarcely recall the\n",
       "shadows and fancies conjured up by the gloom of the preceding night; or\n",
       "believe that the scenes around me, so naked and apparent, could have\n",
       "been clothed with such imaginary horrors.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, the dismal howlings and ejaculations I had heard were not ideal;\n",
       "they were soon accounted for, however, by my handmaid Dolores: being the\n",
       "ravings of a poor maniac, a brother of her aunt, who was subject to\n",
       "violent paroxysms, during which he was confined in a vaulted room\n",
       "beneath the Hall of Ambassadors.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the course of a few evenings a thorough change took place in the\n",
       "scene and its associations. The moon, which when I took possession of my\n",
       "new apartments was invisible, gradually gained each evening upon the\n",
       "darkness of the night, and at length rolled in full splendor above the\n",
       "towers, pouring a flood of tempered light into every court and hall. The\n",
       "garden beneath my window, before wrapped in gloom, was gently lighted\n",
       "up; the orange-and citron-trees were tipped with silver; the fountain\n",
       "sparkled in the moonbeams, and even the blush of the rose was faintly\n",
       "visible.\n",
       "\n",
       "I now felt the poetic merit of the Arabic inscription on the\n",
       "walls,--“How beauteous is this garden; where the flowers of the earth\n",
       "vie with the stars of heaven. What can compare with the vase of yon\n",
       "alabaster fountain filled with crystal water? nothing but the moon in\n",
       "her fulness, shining in the midst of an unclouded sky!”\n",
       "\n",
       "On such heavenly nights I would sit for hours at my window inhaling the\n",
       "sweetness of the garden, and musing on the checkered fortunes of those\n",
       "whose history was dimly shadowed out in the elegant memorials around.\n",
       "Sometimes, when all was quiet, and the clock from the distant cathedral\n",
       "of Granada struck the midnight hour, I have sallied out on another tour\n",
       "and wandered over the whole building; but how different from my first\n",
       "tour! No longer dark and mysterious; no longer peopled with shadowy\n",
       "foes; no longer recalling scenes of violence and murder; all was open,\n",
       "spacious, beautiful; everything called up pleasing and romantic fancies;\n",
       "Lindaraxa once more walked in her garden; the gay chivalry of Moslem\n",
       "Granada once more glittered about the Court of Lions! Who can do justice\n",
       "to a moonlight night in such a climate and such a place? The temperature\n",
       "of a summer midnight in Andalusia is perfectly ethereal. We seem lifted\n",
       "up into a purer atmosphere; we feel a serenity of soul, a buoyancy of\n",
       "spirits, an elasticity of frame, which render mere existence happiness.\n",
       "But when moonlight is added to all this, the effect is like enchantment.\n",
       "Under its plastic sway the Alhambra seems to regain its pristine\n",
       "glories. Every rent and chasm of time; every mouldering tint and\n",
       "weather-stain is gone; the marble resumes its original whiteness; the\n",
       "long colonnades brighten in the moonbeams; the halls are illuminated\n",
       "with a softened radiance,--we tread the enchanted palace of an Arabian\n",
       "tale!\n",
       "\n",
       "What a delight, at such a time, to ascend to the little airy pavilion of\n",
       "the queen’s toilette (el tocador de la reyna), which, like a bird-cage,\n",
       "overhangs the valley of the Darro, and gaze from its light arcades upon\n",
       "the moonlight prospect! To the right, the swelling mountains of the\n",
       "Sierra Nevada, robbed of their ruggedness and softened into a fairy\n",
       "land, with their snowy summits gleaming like silver clouds against the\n",
       "deep blue sky. And then to lean over the parapet of the Tocador and gaze\n",
       "down upon Granada and the Albaycin spread out like a map below; all\n",
       "buried in deep repose; the white palaces and convents sleeping in the\n",
       "moonshine, and beyond all these the vapory Vega fading away like a\n",
       "dreamland in the distance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sometimes the faint click of castanets rise from the Alameda, where some\n",
       "gay Andalusians are dancing away the summer night. Sometimes the dubious\n",
       "tones of a guitar and the notes of an amorous voice, tell perchance the\n",
       "whereabout of some moonstruck lover serenading his lady’s window.\n",
       "\n",
       "Such is a faint picture of the moonlight nights I have passed loitering\n",
       "about the courts and halls and balconies of this most suggestive pile;\n",
       "“feeding my fancy with sugared suppositions,” and enjoying that mixture\n",
       "of reverie and sensation which steal away existence in a southern\n",
       "climate; so that it has been almost morning before I have retired to\n",

       "castle, cathedral, Moorish towers, and Gothic domes, crumbling ruins,\n",

       "during the minority of Alfonso XI., had already laid waste the country\n",
       "from Alcaudete to Alcalá la Real, capturing the castle of Illora and\n",
       "setting fire to its suburbs, and they now carried their insulting\n",

       "Ismael, though a young and intrepid prince, hesitated to accept the\n",
       "challenge. He had not sufficient force at hand, and awaited the arrival\n",
       "of troops summoned from the neighboring towns. The Christian princes,\n",
       "mistaking his motives, gave up all hope of drawing him forth, and having\n",
       "glutted themselves with ravage, struck their tents and began their\n",
       "homeward march. Don Pedro led the van, and Don Juan brought up the rear,\n",

       "were overtaken in the defiles of the mountains. A panic seized them;\n",
       "they were completely routed, and driven with great slaughter across the\n",
       "borders. Both of the princes lost their lives. The body of Don Pedro was\n",
       "carried off by his soldiers, but that of Don Juan was lost in the\n",
       "darkness of the night. His son wrote to the Moorish king, entreating\n",
       "that the body of his father might be sought and honorably treated.\n",
       "Ismael forgot in a moment that Don Juan was an enemy, who had carried\n",
       "ravage and insult to the very gate of his capital; he only thought of\n",
       "him as a gallant cavalier and a royal prince. By his command diligent\n",

       "\n",
       "We have had a scene of a petty tribulation in the Alhambra, which has\n",
       "thrown a cloud over the sunny countenance of Dolores. This little damsel\n",
       "has a female passion for pets of all kinds; and from the superabundant\n",
       "kindness of her disposition, one of the ruined courts of the Alhambra is\n",
       "thronged with her favorites. A stately peacock and his hen seem to hold\n",
       "regal sway here, over pompous turkeys, querulous guinea-fowls, and a\n",
       "rabble rout of common cocks and hens. The great delight of Dolores,\n",
       "however, has for some time past been centred in a youthful pair of\n",
       "pigeons, who have lately entered into the holy state of wedlock, and\n",
       "even supplanted a tortoise-shell cat and kittens in her affections.\n",
       "\n",
       "As a tenement for them wherein to commence house-keeping, she had fitted\n",
       "up a small chamber adjacent to the kitchen, the window of which looked\n",
       "into one of the quiet Moorish courts. Here they lived in happy ignorance\n",
       "of any world beyond the court and its sunny roofs. Never had they\n",
       "aspired to soar above the battlements, or to mount to the summit of the\n",
       "towers. Their virtuous union was at length crowned by two spotless and\n",
       "milk-white eggs, to the great joy of their cherishing little mistress.\n",
       "Nothing could be more praiseworthy than the conduct of the young married\n",
       "folks on this interesting occasion. They took turns to sit upon the nest\n",
       "until the eggs were hatched, and while their callow progeny required\n",
       "warmth and shelter;--while one thus stayed at home, the other foraged\n",
       "abroad for food, and brought home abundant supplies.\n",
       "\n",
       "This scene of conjugal felicity has suddenly met with a reverse. Early\n",
       "this morning, as Dolores was feeding the male pigeon, she took a fancy\n",
       "to give him a peep at the great world. Opening a window, therefore,\n",
       "which looks down upon the valley of the Darro, she launched him at once\n",
       "beyond the walls of the Alhambra. For the first time in his life the\n",
       "astonished bird had to try the full vigor of his wings. He swept down\n",
       "into the valley, and then rising upwards with a surge, soared almost to\n",
       "the clouds. Never before had he risen to such a height, or experienced\n",
       "such delight in flying; and, like a young spendthrift just come to his\n",
       "estate, he seemed giddy with excess of liberty, and with the boundless\n",
       "field of action suddenly opened to him. For the whole day he has been\n",
       "circling about in capricious flights, from tower to tower, and tree to\n",
       "tree. Every attempt has been vain to lure him back by scattering grain\n",
       "upon the roofs; he seems to have lost all thought of home, of his tender\n",
       "helpmate, and his callow young. To add to the anxiety of Dolores, he has\n",
       "been joined by two _palomas ladrones_, or robber pigeons, whose instinct\n",
       "it is to entice wandering pigeons to their own dove-cotes. The fugitive,\n",
       "like many other thoughtless youths on their first launching upon the\n",
       "world, seems quite fascinated with these knowing but graceless\n",
       "companions, who have undertaken to show him life, and introduce him to\n",
       "society. He has been soaring with them over all the roofs and steeples\n",
       "of Granada. A thunder-storm has passed over the city, but he has not\n",
       "sought his home; night has closed in, and still he comes not. To deepen\n",
       "the pathos of the affair, the female pigeon, after remaining several\n",
       "hours on the nest without being relieved, at length went forth to seek\n",
       "her recreant mate; but stayed away so long that the young ones perished\n",
       "for want of the warmth and shelter of the parent bosom. At a late hour\n",
       "in the evening, word was brought to Dolores that the truant bird had\n",
       "been seen upon the towers of the Generalife. Now it happens that the\n",
       "_Administrador_ of that ancient palace has likewise a dove-cote, among\n",
       "the inmates of which are said to be two or three of these inveigling\n",
       "birds, the terror of all neighboring pigeon-fanciers. Dolores\n",
       "immediately concluded that the two feathered sharpers who had been seen\n",
       "with her fugitive were these bloods of the Generalife. A council of war\n",
       "was forthwith held in the chamber of Tia Antonia. The Generalife is a\n",
       "distinct jurisdiction from the Alhambra, and of course some punctilio,\n",
       "if not jealousy, exists between their custodians. It was determined,\n",
       "therefore, to send Pèpe, the stuttering lad of the gardens, as\n",
       "ambassador to the Administrador, requesting that if such fugitive should\n",
       "be found in his dominions, he might be given up as a subject of the\n",
       "Alhambra. Pèpe departed accordingly, on his diplomatic expedition,\n",
       "through the moonlit groves and avenues, but returned in an hour with the\n",
       "afflicting intelligence that no such bird was to be found in the\n",
       "dove-cote of the Generalife. The Administrador, however, pledged his\n",
       "sovereign word that if such vagrant should appear there, even at\n",
       "midnight, he should instantly be arrested and sent back prisoner to his\n",
       "little black-eyed mistress.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus stands the melancholy affair, which has occasioned much distress\n",
       "throughout the palace, and has sent the inconsolable Dolores to a\n",

       "morning, was Dolores, with the truant pigeon in her hands, and her eyes\n",
       "sparkling with joy. He had appeared at an early hour on the battlements,\n",
       "hovering shyly about from roof to roof, but at length entered the\n",
       "window, and surrendered himself prisoner. He gained but little credit,\n",
       "however, by his return; for the ravenous manner in which he devoured the\n",
       "food set before him showed that, like the prodigal son, he had been\n",
       "driven home by sheer famine. Dolores upbraided him for his faithless\n",
       "conduct, calling him all manners of vagrant names, though, womanlike,\n",
       "she fondled him at the same time to her bosom, and covered him with\n",

       "to prevent all future soarings;--a precaution which I mention for the\n",

       "I have spoken of a balcony of the central window of the Hall of\n",
       "Ambassadors. It served as a kind of observatory, where I used often to\n",
       "take my seat, and consider not merely the heaven above but the earth\n",
       "beneath. Besides the magnificent prospect which it commanded of\n",
       "mountain, valley, and vega, there was a little busy scene of human life\n",
       "laid open to inspection immediately below. At the foot of the hill was\n",
       "an alameda, or public walk, which, though not so fashionable as the more\n",
       "modern and splendid paseo of the Xenil, still boasted a varied and\n",
       "picturesque concourse. Hither resorted the small gentry of the suburbs,\n",
       "together with priests and friars, who walked for appetite and digestion;\n",
       "majos and majas, the beaux and belles of the lower classes, in their\n",
       "Andalusian dresses; swaggering contrabandistas, and sometimes\n",
       "half-muffled and mysterious loungers of the higher ranks, on some secret\n",
       "assignation.\n",

       "It was a moving picture of Spanish life and character, which I delighted\n",

       "inspection, so I had a smaller one, of pocket size, for the use of my\n",
       "observatory, with which I could sweep the regions below, and bring the\n",
       "countenances of the motley groups so close as almost, at times, to make\n",
       "me think I could divine their conversation by the play and expression of\n",
       "their features. I was thus, in a manner, an invisible observer, and,\n",
       "without quitting my solitude, could throw myself in an instant into the\n",
       "midst of society,--a rare advantage to one of somewhat shy and quiet\n",
       "habits, and fond, like myself, of observing the drama of life without\n",
       "becoming an actor in the scene.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a considerable suburb lying below the Alhambra, filling the\n",
       "narrow gorge of the valley, and extending up the opposite hill of the\n",
       "Albaycin. Many of the houses were built in the Moorish style, round\n",
       "patios, or courts, cooled by fountains and open to the sky; and as the\n",
       "inhabitants passed much of their time in these courts, and on the\n",
       "terraced roofs during the summer season, it follows that many a glance\n",
       "at their domestic life might be obtained by an aërial spectator like\n",

       "I preferred, however, to form conjectural histories for myself, and thus\n",

       "passing under my eye, a whole tissue of schemes, intrigues, and\n",
       "occupations of the busy mortals below. There was scarce a pretty face or\n",
       "a striking figure that I daily saw, about which I had not thus gradually\n",
       "framed a dramatic story, though some of my characters would\n",
       "occasionally act in direct opposition to the part assigned them, and\n",
       "disconcert the whole drama. Reconnoitring one day with my glass the\n",

       "take the veil; and remarked several circumstances which excited the\n",
       "strongest sympathy in the fate of the youthful being thus about to be\n",
       "consigned to a living tomb. I ascertained to my satisfaction that she\n",
       "was beautiful, and, from the paleness of her cheek, that she was a\n",
       "victim rather than a votary. She was arrayed in bridal garments, and\n",
       "decked with a chaplet of white flowers, but her heart evidently revolted\n",
       "at this mockery of a spiritual union, and yearned after its earthly\n",
       "loves. A tall stern-looking man walked near her in the procession: it\n",
       "was, of course, the tyrannical father, who, from some bigoted or sordid\n",
       "motive, had compelled this sacrifice. Amid the crowd was a dark handsome\n",
       "youth, in Andalusian garb, who seemed to fix on her an eye of agony. It\n",
       "was doubtless the secret lover from whom she was forever to be\n",
       "separated. My indignation rose as I noted the malignant expression\n",
       "painted on the countenances of the attendant monks and friars. The\n",
       "procession arrived at the chapel of the convent; the sun gleamed for the\n",
       "last time upon the chaplet of the poor novice, as she crossed the fatal\n",
       "threshold and disappeared within the building. The throng poured in with\n",
       "cowl, and cross, and minstrelsy; the lover paused for a moment at the\n",
       "door. I could divine the tumult of his feelings; but he mastered them,\n",
       "and entered. There was a long interval. I pictured to myself the scene\n",

       "clothed in the conventual garb; the bridal chaplet taken from her brow,\n",
       "and her beautiful head shorn of its long silken tresses. I heard her\n",
       "murmur the irrevocable vow. I saw her extended on a bier; the death-pall\n",
       "spread over her; the funeral service performed that proclaimed her dead\n",
       "to the world; her sighs were drowned in the deep tones of the organ,\n",
       "and the plaintive requiem of the nuns; the father looked on, unmoved,\n",

       "conversation. The latter was vehement in his gesticulations; I expected\n",
       "some violent termination to my drama; but an angle of a building\n",
       "interfered and closed the scene. My eye afterwards was frequently turned\n",
       "to that convent with painful interest. I remarked late at night a\n",
       "solitary light twinkling from a remote lattice of one of its towers.\n",
       "“There,” said I, “the unhappy nun sits weeping in her cell, while\n",

       "flight. The heroine of my romance was neither young nor handsome; she\n",
       "had no lover; she had entered the convent of her own free will, as a\n",
       "respectable asylum, and was one of the most cheerful residents within\n",

       "It was some little while before I could forgive the wrong done me by the\n",

       "two, the pretty coquetries of a dark-eyed brunette, who, from the covert\n",
       "of a balcony shrouded with flowering shrubs and a silken awning, was\n",
       "carrying on a mysterious correspondence with a handsome, dark,\n",
       "well-whiskered cavalier, who lurked frequently in the street beneath her\n",

       "the eyes in a mantle. Sometimes he loitered at a corner, in various\n",
       "disguises, apparently waiting for a private signal to slip into the\n",
       "house. Then there was the tinkling of a guitar at night and a lantern\n",
       "shifted from place to place in the balcony. I imagined another intrigue\n",
       "like that of Almaviva, but was again disconcerted in all my\n",
       "suppositions. The supposed lover turned out to be the husband of the\n",
       "lady, and a noted contrabandista; and all his mysterious signs and\n",

       "THE ADVENTURE OF THE MASON\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "There was once upon a time a poor mason, or bricklayer, in Granada, who\n",
       "kept all the saints’ days and holidays, and Saint Monday into the\n",
       "bargain, and yet, with all his devotion, he grew poorer and poorer, and\n",
       "could scarcely earn bread for his numerous family. One night he was\n",
       "roused from his first sleep by a knocking at his door. He opened it, and\n",
       "beheld before him a tall, meagre, cadaverous-looking priest.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Hark ye, honest friend!’ said the stranger; ‘I have observed that you\n",
       "are a good Christian, and one to be trusted; will you undertake a job\n",
       "this very night?’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘With all my heart, Señor Padre, on condition that I am paid\n",
       "accordingly.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘That you shall be; but you must suffer yourself to be blindfolded.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“To this the mason made no objection. So, being hoodwinked, he was led\n",
       "by the priest through various rough lanes and winding passages, until\n",
       "they stopped before the portal of a house. The priest then applied a\n",
       "key, turned a creaking lock, and opened what sounded like a ponderous\n",
       "door. They entered, the door was closed and bolted, and the mason was\n",
       "conducted through an echoing corridor and a spacious hall to an interior\n",
       "part of the building. Here the bandage was removed from his eyes, and he\n",
       "found himself in a patio, or court, dimly lighted by a single lamp. In\n",
       "the centre was the dry basin of an old Moorish fountain, under which the\n",
       "priest requested him to form a small vault, bricks and mortar being at\n",
       "hand for the purpose. He accordingly worked all night, but without\n",
       "finishing the job. Just before daybreak the priest put a piece of gold\n",
       "into his hand, and having again blindfolded him, conducted him back to\n",
       "his dwelling.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Are you willing,’ said he, ‘to return and complete your work?’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Gladly, Señor Padre, provided I am so well paid.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Well, then, to-morrow at midnight I will call again.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“He did so, and the vault was completed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Now,’ said the priest, ‘you must help me to bring forth the bodies\n",
       "that are to be buried in this vault.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“The poor mason’s hair rose on his head at these words: he followed the\n",
       "priest, with trembling steps, into a retired chamber of the mansion,\n",
       "expecting to behold some ghastly spectacle of death, but was relieved\n",
       "on perceiving three or four portly jars standing in one corner. They\n",
       "were evidently full of money, and it was with great labor that he and\n",
       "the priest carried them forth and consigned them to their tomb. The\n",
       "vault was then closed, the pavement replaced, and all traces of the work\n",
       "were obliterated. The mason was again hoodwinked and led forth by a\n",
       "route different from that by which he had come. After they had wandered\n",
       "for a long time through a perplexed maze of lanes and alleys, they\n",
       "halted. The priest then put two pieces of gold into his hand: ‘Wait\n",
       "here,’ said he, ‘until you hear the cathedral bell toll for matins. If\n",
       "you presume to uncover your eyes before that time, evil will befall\n",
       "you’: so saying, he departed. The mason waited faithfully, amusing\n",
       "himself by weighing the gold pieces in his hand, and clinking them\n",
       "against each other. The moment the cathedral bell rang its matin peal,\n",
       "he uncovered his eyes, and found himself on the banks of the Xenil;\n",
       "whence he made the best of his way home, and revelled with his family\n",
       "for a whole fortnight on the profits of his two nights’ work; after\n",
       "which he was as poor as ever.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He continued to work a little, and pray a good deal, and keep saints’\n",
       "days and holidays, from year to year, while his family grew up as gaunt\n",
       "and ragged as a crew of gypsies. As he was seated one evening at the\n",
       "door of his hovel, he was accosted by a rich old curmudgeon, who was\n",
       "noted for owning many houses, and being a griping landlord. The man of\n",
       "money eyed him for a moment from beneath a pair of anxious shagged\n",
       "eyebrows.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘I am told, friend, that you are very poor.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘There is no denying the fact, Señor,--it speaks for itself.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘I presume, then, that you will be glad of a job, and will work cheap.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘As cheap, my master, as any mason in Granada.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘That’s what I want. I have an old house fallen into decay, which costs\n",
       "me more money than it is worth to keep it in repair, for nobody will\n",
       "live in it; so I must contrive to patch it up and keep it together at as\n",
       "small expense as possible.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“The mason was accordingly conducted to a large deserted house that\n",
       "seemed going to ruin. Passing through several empty halls and chambers,\n",
       "he entered an inner court, where his eye was caught by an old Moorish\n",
       "fountain. He paused for a moment, for a dreaming recollection of the\n",
       "place came over him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Pray,’ said he, ‘who occupied this house formerly?’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘A pest upon him!’ cried the landlord; ‘it was an old miserly priest,\n",
       "who cared for nobody but himself. He was said to be immensely rich, and,\n",
       "having no relations, it was thought he would leave all his treasures to\n",
       "the Church. He died suddenly, and the priests and friars thronged to\n",
       "take possession of his wealth; but nothing could they find but a few\n",
       "ducats in a leathern purse. The worst luck has fallen on me, for, since\n",
       "his death, the old fellow continues to occupy my house without paying\n",
       "rent, and there is no taking the law of a dead man. The people pretend\n",
       "to hear the clinking of gold all night in the chamber where the old\n",
       "priest slept, as if he were counting over his money, and sometimes a\n",
       "groaning and moaning about the court. Whether true or false, these\n",
       "stories have brought a bad name on my house, and not a tenant will\n",
       "remain in it.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Enough,’ said the mason sturdily: ‘let me live in your house rent-free\n",
       "until some better tenant present, and I will engage to put it in repair,\n",
       "and to quiet the troubled spirit that disturbs it. I am a good Christian\n",
       "and a poor man, and am not to be daunted by the Devil himself, even\n",
       "though he should come in the shape of a big bag of money!’\n",
       "\n",
       "“The offer of the honest mason was gladly accepted; he moved with his\n",
       "family into the house, and fulfilled all his engagements. By little and\n",
       "little he restored it to its former state; the clinking of gold was no\n",
       "more heard at night in the chamber of the defunct priest, but began to\n",
       "be heard by day in the pocket of the living mason. In a word, he\n",
       "increased rapidly in wealth, to the admiration of all his neighbors, and\n",
       "became one of the richest men in Granada: he gave large sums to the\n",
       "Church, by way, no doubt, of satisfying his conscience, and never\n",

       "elevate in his place Yusef Aben Alhamar, the eldest of the Celtimerian\n",

       "The royal pageant passed through silent streets, and the barren homage\n",
       "of a court in the halls of the Alhambra ill supplied the want of sincere\n",
       "and popular devotion. Yusef Aben Alhamar felt the insecurity of his\n",
       "position. The deposed monarch was at hand in Malaga; the sovereign of\n",
       "Tunis espoused his cause, and pleaded with the Christian monarchs in his\n",
       "favor; above all, Yusef felt his own unpopularity in Granada; previous\n",
       "fatigues had impaired his health, a profound melancholy settled upon\n",
       "him, and in the course of six months he sank into the grave.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the news of his death, Muhamed the Left-handed hastened from Malaga,\n",

       "he chose as vizier Abdelbar, one of the worthiest of that magnanimous\n",
       "line. Through his advice he restrained his vindictive feelings and\n",
       "adopted a conciliatory policy. He pardoned most of his enemies. Yusef,\n",
       "the defunct usurper, had left three children. His estates were\n",
       "apportioned among them. Aben Celim, the eldest son, was confirmed in\n",
       "the title of Prince of Almeria and Lord of Marchena in the Alpuxarras.\n",
       "Ahmed, the youngest, was made Señor of Luchar; and Equivila, the\n",
       "daughter, received rich patrimonial lands in the fertile Vega, and\n",
       "various houses and shops in the Zacatin of Granada. The vizier Abdelbar\n",
       "counselled the king, moreover, to secure the adherence of the family by\n",
       "matrimonial connections. An aunt of Muhamed was accordingly given in\n",
       "marriage to Aben Celim, while the prince Nasar, younger brother of the\n",
       "deceased usurper, received the hand of the beautiful Lindaraxa, daughter\n",

       "Don Pedro de Venegas alone, the husband of the princess Cetimerien,\n",

       "reverses of their family and the deaths of so many of their bravest\n",
       "cavaliers. The king never spoke of him but by the opprobrious\n",
       "appellation of the Tornadizo, or Renegade. Finding himself in danger of\n",
       "arrest and punishment, he took leave of his wife, the princess, his two\n",
       "sons, Abul Cacim and Reduan, and his daughter, Cetimerien, and fled to\n",
       "Jaen. There, like his brother-in-law, the usurper, he expiated his\n",

       "and died in 1434 a penitent, because a disappointed man.[9]\n",

       "Muhamed el Hayzari was doomed to further reverses. He had two nephews,\n",

       "beautiful girl, when his royal uncle interfered and gave her to one of\n",

       "horse and weapons and sallied from Granada for the frontier, followed by\n",
       "numerous cavaliers. The affair gave general disgust, especially to the\n",
       "Abencerrages who were attached to the prince. No sooner did tidings\n",

       "Throwing himself suddenly into Granada, he raised a popular tumult,\n",

       "offering to support his pretensions to the throne, and advising him to\n",

       "Juan II. The prince, however, confiding in the generosity of the\n",
       "Castilian monarch, told frankly the whole matter. He was not mistaken.\n",
       "King Juan not merely gave him permission to depart, but promised him\n",
       "aid, and gave him letters to that effect to his commanders on the\n",

       "safety at Montefrio, and was proclaimed king of Granada by Abdelbar and\n",

       "part of the tower would have served for the purpose. The external walls\n",
       "of these chambers are of prodigious thickness, pierced with small\n",
       "windows secured by iron bars. A narrow stone gallery, with a low\n",
       "parapet, extends along three sides of the tower just below the windows,\n",

       "once an immense pile, called the Tower of the Seven Floors (_la Torre de\n",
       "los siete suelos_). It is famous in the neighborhood as the scene of\n",
       "strange apparitions and Moorish enchantments. According to Swinburne the\n",

       "rugged ravine beset by thickets of aloes and Indian figs, and lined with\n",

       "I spurred my horse to the summit of a rock, where Boabdil uttered his\n",

       "farewell gaze: it is still denominated _el ultimo suspiro del Moro_ (the\n",
       "last sigh of the Moor). Who can wonder at his anguish at being expelled\n",

       "It was here, too, that his affliction was embittered by the reproach of\n",

       "courage; and, in times of difficulty and perplexity, was wavering and\n",
       "irresolute. This feebleness of spirit hastened his downfall, while it\n",

       "Under the guidance of Mateo, I made my way through streets already\n",
       "teeming with a holiday population, to the square of the Vivarrambla,\n",
       "that great place for tilts and tourneys so often sung in the Moorish\n",
       "ballads of love and chivalry. A gallery or arcade of wood had been\n",
       "erected along the sides of the square, for the grand religious\n",
       "procession of the following day. This was brilliantly illuminated for\n",
       "the evening as a promenade; and bands of music were stationed on\n",
       "balconies on each of the four façades of the square. All the fashion and\n",
       "beauty of Granada, all of its population of either sex that had good\n",
       "looks or fine clothes to display, thronged this arcade, promenading\n",
       "round and round the Vivarrambla. Here, too, were the _Majos_ and\n",
       "_Majas_, the rural beaux and belles, with fine forms, flashing eyes, and\n",
       "gay Andalusian costumes; some of them from Ronda itself, that stronghold\n",
       "of the mountains, famous for contrabandistas, bullfighters, and\n",
       "beautiful women.\n",
       "\n",
       "While this gay but motley throng kept up a constant circulation in the\n",
       "gallery, the centre of the square was occupied by the peasantry from the\n",
       "surrounding country; who made no pretensions to display, but came for\n",
       "simple, hearty enjoyment. The whole square was covered with them;\n",
       "forming separate groups of families and neighborhoods, like gypsy\n",
       "encampments, some were listening to the traditional ballad drawled out\n",
       "to the tinkling of the guitar; some were engaged in gay conversation;\n",
       "some were dancing to the click of the castanet. As I threaded my way\n",
       "through this teeming region with Mateo at my heels, I passed\n",
       "occasionally some rustic party, seated on the ground, making a merry\n",
       "though frugal repast. If they caught my eye as I loitered by, they\n",
       "almost invariably invited me to partake of their simple fare. This\n",
       "hospitable usage, inherited from their Moslem invaders, and originating\n",
       "in the tent of the Arab, is universal throughout the land, and observed\n",
       "by the poorest Spaniard.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the night advanced, the gayety gradually died away in the arcades;\n",
       "the bands of music ceased to play, and the brilliant crowd dispersed to\n",
       "their homes. The centre of the square still remained well peopled, and\n",
       "Mateo assured me that the greater part of the peasantry, men, women, and\n",
       "children, would pass the night there, sleeping on the bare earth beneath\n",
       "the open canopy of heaven. Indeed, a summer night requires no shelter in\n",
       "this favored climate; and a bed is a superfluity which many of the hardy\n",
       "peasantry of Spain never enjoy, and which some of them affect to\n",
       "despise. The common Spaniard wraps himself in his brown cloak, stretches\n",
       "himself on his manta or mule-cloth, and sleeps soundly, luxuriously\n",
       "accommodated if he can have a saddle for a pillow. In a little while the\n",
       "words of Mateo were made good; the peasant multitude nestled down on the\n",
       "ground to their night’s repose, and by midnight the scene on the\n",
       "Vivarrambla resembled the bivouac of an army.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next morning, accompanied by Mateo, I revisited the square at\n",
       "sunrise. It was still strewed with groups of sleepers: some were\n",
       "reposing from the dance and revel of the evening; others, who had left\n",
       "their villages after work on the preceding day, having trudged on foot\n",
       "the greater part of the night, were taking a sound sleep to freshen\n",
       "themselves for the festivities of the day. Numbers from the mountains,\n",
       "and the remote villages of the plain, who had set out in the night,\n",
       "continued to arrive with their wives and children. All were in high\n",
       "spirits; greeting each other and exchanging jokes and pleasantries. The\n",
       "gay tumult thickened as the day advanced. Now came pouring in at the\n",
       "city gates, and parading through the streets, the deputations from the\n",
       "various villages, destined to swell the grand procession. These village\n",
       "deputations were headed by their priests, bearing their respective\n",
       "crosses and banners, and images of the blessed Virgin and of patron\n",
       "saints; all which were matters of great rivalship and jealousy among the\n",
       "peasantry. It was like the chivalrous gatherings of ancient days, when\n",
       "each town and village sent its chiefs, and warriors, and standards, to\n",
       "defend the capital, or grace its festivities.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length all these various detachments congregated into one grand\n",
       "pageant, which slowly paraded round the Vivarrambla, and through the\n",
       "principal streets, where every window and balcony was hung with\n",
       "tapestry. In this procession were all the religious orders, the civil\n",
       "and military authorities, and the chief people of the parishes and\n",
       "villages: every church and convent had contributed its banners, its\n",
       "images, its relics, and poured forth its wealth for the occasion. In the\n",
       "centre of the procession walked the archbishop, under a damask canopy,\n",
       "and surrounded by inferior dignitaries and their dependants. The whole\n",
       "moved to the swell and cadence of numerous bands of music, and, passing\n",
       "through the midst of a countless yet silent multitude, proceeded onward\n",
       "to the cathedral.\n",
       "\n",
       "I could not but be struck with the changes of times and customs, as I\n",
       "saw this monkish pageant passing through the Vivarrambla, the ancient\n",
       "seat of Moslem pomp and chivalry. The contrast was indeed forced upon\n",
       "the mind by the decorations of the square. The whole front of the wooden\n",
       "gallery erected for the procession, extending several hundred feet, was\n",
       "faced with canvas, on which some humble though patriotic artist had\n",
       "painted, by contract, a series of the principal scenes and exploits of\n",
       "the Conquest, as recorded in chronicle and romance. It is thus the\n",
       "romantic legends of Granada mingle themselves with everything, and are\n",
       "kept fresh in the public mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "As we wended our way back to the Alhambra, Mateo was in high glee and\n",
       "garrulous vein. “Ah, Señor,” exclaimed he, “there is no place in all the\n",
       "world like Granada for grand ceremonies (_funciones grandes_); a man\n",

       "Pero, el dia de la Toma! Ah, Señor! el dia de la Toma! “But the day of\n",

       "which crowned Mateo’s notions of perfect felicity. The Dia de la Toma, I\n",
       "found, was the anniversary of the capture or taking possession of\n",

       "of the cathedral, and placed before their sepulchre, where their\n",
       "effigies lie in monumental marble. High mass is then performed in memory\n",
       "of the Conquest; and at a certain part of the ceremony the Alferez mayor\n",

       "Hazañas” (he of the exploits), a madcap warrior, the favorite hero of\n",

       "one occasion this Hernando del Pulgar, at the head of a handful of\n",
       "followers, made a dash into Granada in the dead of the night, nailed the\n",
       "inscription of AVE MARIA with his dagger to the gate of the principal\n",

       "stoutest among them, paraded in front of the Christian army, dragging\n",
       "the tablet bearing the sacred inscription AVE MARIA, at his horse’s\n",
       "tail. The cause of the Virgin was eagerly vindicated by Garcilaso de la\n",

       "precious effects, hoping that their exile would be but temporary, and\n",
       "that they would be enabled to return and retrieve their treasures at\n",

       "\n",
       "In old times, many hundred years ago, there was a Moorish king named\n",
       "Aben Habuz, who reigned over the kingdom of Granada. He was a retired\n",
       "conqueror, that is to say, one who, having in his more youthful days led\n",
       "a life of constant foray and depredation, now that he was grown feeble\n",
       "and superannuated, “languished for repose,” and desired nothing more\n",
       "than to live at peace with all the world, to husband his laurels, and to\n",
       "enjoy in quiet the possessions he had wrested from his neighbors.\n",
       "\n",
       "It so happened, however, that this most reasonable and pacific old\n",
       "monarch had young rivals to deal with; princes full of his early passion\n",
       "for fame and fighting, and who were disposed to call him to account for\n",
       "the scores he had run up with their fathers. Certain distant districts\n",
       "of his own territories, also, which during the days of his vigor he had\n",
       "treated with a high hand, were prone, now that he languished for repose,\n",
       "to rise in rebellion and threaten to invest him in his capital. Thus he\n",
       "had foes on every side; and as Granada is surrounded by wild and craggy\n",
       "mountains, which hide the approach of an enemy, the unfortunate Aben\n",
       "Habuz was kept in a constant state of vigilance and alarm, not knowing\n",
       "in what quarter hostilities might break out.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was in vain that he built watch-towers on the mountains, and\n",
       "stationed guards at every pass with orders to make fires by night and\n",
       "smoke by day, on the approach of an enemy. His alert foes, baffling\n",
       "every precaution, would break out of some unthought-of defile, ravage\n",
       "his lands beneath his very nose, and then make off with prisoners and\n",
       "booty to the mountains. Was ever peaceable and retired conqueror in a\n",
       "more uncomfortable predicament?\n",
       "\n",
       "While Aben Habuz was harassed by these perplexities and molestations, an\n",
       "ancient Arabian physician arrived at his court. His gray beard descended\n",
       "to his girdle, and he had every mark of extreme age, yet he had\n",
       "travelled almost the whole way from Egypt on foot, with no other aid\n",
       "than a staff, marked with hieroglyphics. His fame had preceded him. His\n",
       "name was Ibrahim Ebn Abu Ayub; he was said to have lived ever since the\n",
       "days of Mahomet, and to be son of Abu Ayub; the last of the companions\n",
       "of the Prophet. He had, when a child, followed the conquering army of\n",
       "Amru into Egypt, where he had remained many years studying the dark\n",
       "sciences, and particularly magic, among the Egyptian priests.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was, moreover, said that he had found out the secret of prolonging\n",
       "life, by means of which he had arrived to the great age of upwards of\n",
       "two centuries, though, as he did not discover the secret until well\n",
       "stricken in years, he could only perpetuate his gray hairs and wrinkles.\n",
       "\n",
       "This wonderful old man was honorably entertained by the king; who, like\n",
       "most superannuated monarchs, began to take physicians into great favor.\n",
       "He would have assigned him an apartment in his palace, but the\n",
       "astrologer preferred a cave in the side of the hill which rises above\n",
       "the city of Granada, being the same on which the Alhambra has since been\n",
       "built. He caused the cave to be enlarged so as to form a spacious and\n",
       "lofty hall, with a circular hole at the top, through which, as through a\n",
       "well, he could see the heavens and behold the stars even at mid-day. The\n",
       "walls of this hall were covered with Egyptian hieroglyphics with\n",
       "cabalistic symbols, and with the figures of the stars in their signs.\n",
       "This hall he furnished with many implements, fabricated under his\n",
       "directions by cunning artificers of Granada, but the occult properties\n",
       "of which were known only to himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "In a little while the sage Ibrahim became the bosom counsellor of the\n",
       "king, who applied to him for advice in every emergency. Aben Habuz was\n",
       "once inveighing against the injustice of his neighbors, and bewailing\n",
       "the restless vigilance he had to observe to guard himself against their\n",
       "invasions; when he had finished, the astrologer remained silent for a\n",
       "moment, and then replied, “Know, O king, that, when I was in Egypt, I\n",
       "beheld a great marvel devised by a pagan priestess of old. On a\n",
       "mountain, above the city of Borsa and overlooking the great valley of\n",
       "the Nile, was a figure of a ram, and above it a figure of a cock, both\n",
       "of molten brass, and turning upon a pivot. Whenever the country was\n",
       "threatened with invasion, the ram would turn in the direction of the\n",
       "enemy, and the cock would crow; upon this the inhabitants of the city\n",
       "knew of the danger, and of the quarter from which it was approaching,\n",
       "and could take timely means to guard against it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“God is great!” exclaimed the pacific Aben Habuz, “what a treasure would\n",
       "be such a ram to keep an eye upon these mountains around me; and then\n",
       "such a cock, to crow in time of danger! Allah Akbar! how securely I\n",
       "might sleep in my palace with such sentinels on the top!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The astrologer waited until the ecstasies of the king had subsided, and\n",
       "then proceeded.\n",
       "\n",
       "“After the victorious Amru (may he rest in peace!) had finished his\n",
       "conquest of Egypt, I remained among the priests of the land, studying\n",
       "the rites and ceremonies of their idolatrous faith, and seeking to make\n",
       "myself master of the hidden knowledge for which they are renowned. I was\n",
       "one day seated on the banks of the Nile, conversing with an ancient\n",
       "priest, when he pointed to the mighty pyramids which rose like mountains\n",
       "out of the neighboring desert. ‘All that we can teach thee,’ said he,\n",
       "‘is nothing to the knowledge locked up in those mighty piles. In the\n",
       "centre of the central pyramid is a sepulchral chamber, in which is\n",
       "enclosed the mummy of the high-priest who aided in rearing that\n",
       "stupendous pile; and with him is buried a wondrous book of knowledge,\n",
       "containing all the secrets of magic and art. This book was given to Adam\n",
       "after his fall, and was handed down from generation to generation to\n",
       "King Solomon the Wise, and by its aid he built the Temple of Jerusalem.\n",
       "How it came into the possession of the builder of the pyramids is known\n",
       "to Him alone who knows all things.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“When I heard these words of the Egyptian priest, my heart burned to get\n",
       "possession of that book. I could command the services of many of the\n",
       "soldiers of our conquering army, and of a number of the native\n",
       "Egyptians: with these I set to work, and pierced the solid mass of the\n",
       "pyramid, until, after great toil, I came upon one of its interior and\n",
       "hidden passages. Following this up, and threading a fearful labyrinth, I\n",
       "penetrated into the very heart of the pyramids, even to the sepulchral\n",
       "chamber, where the mummy of the high-priest had lain for ages. I broke\n",
       "through the outer cases of the mummy, unfolded its many wrappers and\n",
       "bandages, and at length found the precious volume on its bosom. I seized\n",
       "it with a trembling hand, and groped my way out of the pyramid, leaving\n",
       "the mummy in its dark and silent sepulchre, there to await the final day\n",
       "of resurrection and judgment.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Son of Abu Ayub,” exclaimed Aben Habuz, “thou hast been a great\n",
       "traveller, and seen marvellous things; but of what avail to me is the\n",
       "secret of the pyramid, and the volume of knowledge of the wise Solomon?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“This it is, O king! By the study of that book I am instructed in all\n",
       "magic arts, and can command the assistance of genii to accomplish my\n",
       "plans. The mystery of the Talisman of Borsa is therefore familiar to me,\n",
       "and such a talisman can I make, nay, one of greater virtues.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“O wise son of Abu Ayub,” cried Aben Habuz, “better were such a talisman\n",
       "than all the watch-towers on the hills, and sentinels upon the borders.\n",
       "Give me such a safeguard, and the riches of my treasury are at thy\n",
       "command.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The astrologer immediately set to work to gratify the wishes of the\n",
       "monarch. He caused a great tower to be erected upon the top of the royal\n",
       "palace, which stood on the brow of the hill of the Albaycin. The tower\n",
       "was built of stones brought from Egypt, and taken, it is said, from one\n",
       "of the pyramids. In the upper part of the tower was a circular hall,\n",
       "with windows looking towards every point of the compass, and before each\n",
       "window was a table, on which was arranged, as on a chess-board, a mimic\n",
       "army of horse and foot, with the effigy of the potentate that ruled in\n",
       "that direction, all carved of wood. To each of these tables there was a\n",
       "small lance, no bigger than a bodkin, on which were engraved certain\n",
       "Chaldaic characters. This hall was kept constantly closed, by a gate of\n",
       "brass, with a great lock of steel, the key of which was in possession of\n",
       "the king.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the top of the tower was a bronze figure of a Moorish horseman, fixed\n",
       "on a pivot, with a shield on one arm, and his lance elevated\n",
       "perpendicularly. The face of this horseman was towards the city, as if\n",
       "keeping guard over it; but if any foe were at hand, the figure would\n",
       "turn in that direction, and would level the lance as if for action.\n",
       "\n",
       "When this talisman was finished, Aben Habuz was all impatient to try its\n",
       "virtues, and longed as ardently for an invasion as he had ever sighed\n",
       "after repose. His desire was soon gratified. Tidings were brought, early\n",
       "one morning, by the sentinel appointed to watch the tower, that the face\n",
       "of the bronze horseman was turned towards the mountains of Elvira, and\n",
       "that his lance pointed directly against the Pass of Lope.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Let the drums and trumpets sound to arms, and all Granada be put on the\n",
       "alert,” said Aben Habuz.\n",
       "\n",
       "“O king,” said the astrologer, “let not your city be disquieted, nor\n",
       "your warriors called to arms; we need no aid of force to deliver you\n",
       "from your enemies. Dismiss your attendants, and let us proceed alone to\n",
       "the secret hall of the tower.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The ancient Aben Habuz mounted the staircase of the tower, leaning on\n",
       "the arm of the still more ancient Ibrahim Ebn Abu Ayub. They unlocked\n",
       "the brazen door and entered. The window that looked towards the Pass of\n",
       "Lope was open. “In this direction,” said the astrologer, “lies the\n",
       "danger; approach, O king, and behold the mystery of the table.”\n",
       "\n",
       "King Aben Habuz approached the seeming chess-board, on which were\n",
       "arranged the small wooden effigies, when, to his surprise, he perceived\n",
       "that they were all in motion. The horses pranced and curveted, the\n",
       "warriors brandished their weapons, and there was a faint sound of drums\n",
       "and trumpets, and the clang of arms, and neighing of steeds; but all no\n",
       "louder, nor more distinct, than the hum of the bee, or the summer-fly,\n",
       "in the drowsy ear of him who lies at noontide in the shade.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Behold, O king,” said the astrologer, “a proof that thy enemies are\n",
       "even now in the field. They must be advancing through yonder mountains,\n",
       "by the Pass of Lope. Would you produce a panic and confusion amongst\n",
       "them, and cause them to retreat without loss of life, strike these\n",
       "effigies with the but-end of this magic lance; would you cause bloody\n",
       "feud and carnage, strike with the point.”\n",
       "\n",
       "A livid streak passed across the countenance of Aben Habuz; he seized\n",
       "the lance with trembling eagerness; his gray beard wagged with\n",
       "exultation as he tottered toward the table: “Son of Abu Ayub,” exclaimed\n",
       "he, in chuckling tone, “I think we will have a little blood!”\n",
       "\n",
       "So saying, he thrust the magic lance into some of the pigmy effigies,\n",
       "and belabored others with the but-end, upon which the former fell as\n",
       "dead upon the board, and the rest turning upon each other, began,\n",
       "pell-mell, a chance-medley fight.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was with difficulty the astrologer could stay the hand of the most\n",
       "pacific of monarchs, and prevent him from absolutely exterminating his\n",
       "foes; at length he prevailed upon him to leave the tower, and to send\n",
       "out scouts to the mountains by the Pass of Lope.\n",
       "\n",
       "They returned with the intelligence that a Christian army had advanced\n",
       "through the heart of the Sierra, almost within sight of Granada, where a\n",
       "dissension had broken out among them; they had turned their weapons\n",
       "against each other, and after much slaughter had retreated over the\n",
       "border.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aben Habuz was transported with joy on thus proving the efficacy of the\n",
       "talisman. “At length,” said he, “I shall lead a life of tranquillity,\n",
       "and have all my enemies in my power. O wise son of Abu Ayub, what can I\n",
       "bestow on thee in reward for such a blessing?” “The wants of an old man\n",
       "and a philosopher, O king, are few and simple; grant me but the means of\n",
       "fitting up my cave as a suitable hermitage, and I am content.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“How noble is the moderation of the truly wise!” exclaimed Aben Habuz,\n",
       "secretly pleased at the cheapness of the recompense. He summoned his\n",
       "treasurer, and bade him dispense whatever sums might be required by\n",
       "Ibrahim to complete and furnish his hermitage.\n",
       "\n",
       "The astrologer now gave orders to have various chambers hewn out of the\n",
       "solid rock, so as to form ranges of apartments connected with his\n",
       "astrological hall; these he caused to be furnished with luxurious\n",
       "ottomans and divans, and the walls to be hung with the richest silks of\n",
       "Damascus. “I am an old man,” said he, “and can no longer rest my bones\n",
       "on stone couches, and these damp walls require covering.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He had baths too constructed, and provided with all kinds of perfumes\n",
       "and aromatic oils. “For a bath,” said he, “is necessary to counteract\n",
       "the rigidity of age, and to restore freshness and suppleness to the\n",
       "frame withered by study.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He caused the apartments to be hung with innumerable silver and crystal\n",
       "lamps, which he filled with a fragrant oil prepared according to a\n",
       "receipt discovered by him in the tombs of Egypt. This oil was perpetual\n",
       "in its nature, and diffused a soft radiance like the tempered light of\n",
       "day. “The light of the sun,” said he, “is too garish and violent for the\n",
       "eyes of an old man, and the light of the lamp is more congenial to the\n",
       "studies of a philosopher.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The treasurer of King Aben Habuz groaned at the sums daily demanded to\n",
       "fit up this hermitage, and he carried his complaints to the king. The\n",
       "royal word, however, had been given; Aben Habuz shrugged his shoulders:\n",
       "“We must have patience,” said he; “this old man has taken his idea of a\n",
       "philosophic retreat from the interior of the pyramids, and of the vast\n",
       "ruins of Egypt; but all things have an end, and so will the furnishing\n",
       "of his cavern.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The king was in the right; the hermitage was at length complete, and\n",
       "formed a sumptuous subterranean palace. The astrologer expressed himself\n",
       "perfectly content, and, shutting himself up, remained for three whole\n",
       "days buried in study. At the end of that time he appeared again before\n",
       "the treasurer. “One thing more is necessary,” said he, “one trifling\n",
       "solace for the intervals of mental labor.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“O wise Ibrahim, I am bound to furnish everything necessary for thy\n",
       "solitude; what more dost thou require?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I would fain have a few dancing-women.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Dancing-women!” echoed the treasurer, with surprise.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Dancing-women,” replied the sage, gravely; “and let them be young and\n",
       "fair to look upon; for the sight of youth and beauty is refreshing. A\n",
       "few will suffice, for I am a philosopher of simple habits and easily\n",
       "satisfied.”\n",
       "\n",
       "While the philosophic Ibrahim Ebn Abu Ayub passed his time thus sagely\n",
       "in his hermitage, the pacific Aben Habuz carried on furious campaigns in\n",
       "effigy in his tower. It was a glorious thing for an old man, like\n",
       "himself, of quiet habits, to have war made easy, and to be enabled to\n",
       "amuse himself in his chamber by brushing away whole armies like so many\n",
       "swarms of flies.\n",
       "\n",
       "For a time he rioted in the indulgence of his humors, and even taunted\n",
       "and insulted his neighbors, to induce them to make incursions; but by\n",
       "degrees they grew wary from repeated disasters, until no one ventured to\n",
       "invade his territories. For many months the bronze horseman remained on\n",
       "the peace establishment, with his lance elevated in the air; and the\n",
       "worthy old monarch began to repine at the want of his accustomed sport,\n",
       "and to grow peevish at his monotonous tranquillity.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length, one day, the talismanic horseman veered suddenly round, and\n",
       "lowering his lance, made a dead point towards the mountains of Guadix.\n",
       "Aben Habuz hastened to his tower, but the magic table in that direction\n",
       "remained quiet; not a single warrior was in motion. Perplexed at the\n",
       "circumstance, he sent forth a troop of horse to scour the mountains and\n",
       "reconnoitre. They returned after three days’ absence.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We have searched every mountain pass,” said they, “but not a helm nor\n",
       "spear was stirring. All that we have found in the course of our foray,\n",
       "was a Christian damsel of surpassing beauty, sleeping at noontide beside\n",
       "a fountain, whom we have brought away captive.”\n",

       "whiteness were entwined with her raven tresses; and jewels sparkled on\n",

       "those northern sorceresses of whom we have heard, who assume the most\n",
       "seductive forms to beguile the unwary. Methinks I read witchcraft in her\n",
       "eye, and sorcery in every movement. Doubtless this is the enemy pointed\n",
       "out by the talisman.”\n",

       "finds favor in my eyes.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Dancing-women have I, it is true, but no singing-women. I would fain\n",

       "study.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A truce with thy hermit cravings,” said the king, impatiently. “This\n",

       "of Abishag the Shunamite.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Further solicitations and remonstrances of the astrologer only provoked\n",
       "a more peremptory reply from the monarch, and they parted in high\n",
       "displeasure. The sage shut himself up in his hermitage to brood over\n",
       "his disappointment; ere he departed, however, he gave the king one more\n",
       "warning to beware of his dangerous captive. But where is the old man in\n",
       "love that will listen to counsel? Aben Habuz resigned himself to the\n",
       "full sway of his passion. His only study was how to render himself\n",
       "amiable in the eyes of the Gothic beauty. He had not youth to recommend\n",
       "him, it is true, but then he had riches; and when a lover is old, he is\n",
       "generally generous. The Zacatin of Granada was ransacked for the most\n",
       "precious merchandise of the East; silks, jewels, precious gems,\n",
       "exquisite perfumes, all that Asia and Africa yielded of rich and rare,\n",
       "were lavished upon the princess. All kinds of spectacles and festivities\n",
       "were devised for her entertainment; minstrelsy, dancing, tournaments,\n",
       "bull-fights;--Granada for a time was a scene of perpetual pageant. The\n",
       "Gothic princess regarded all this splendor with the air of one\n",
       "accustomed to magnificence. She received everything as a homage due to\n",
       "her rank, or rather to her beauty; for beauty is more lofty in its\n",
       "exactions even than rank. Nay, she seemed to take a secret pleasure in\n",
       "exciting the monarch to expenses that made his treasury shrink, and then\n",
       "treating his extravagant generosity as a mere matter of course. With all\n",
       "his assiduity and munificence, also, the venerable lover could not\n",
       "flatter himself that he had made any impression on her heart. She never\n",
       "frowned on him, it is true, but then she never smiled. Whenever he began\n",
       "to plead his passion, she struck her silver lyre. There was a mystic\n",
       "charm in the sound. In an instant the monarch began to nod; a drowsiness\n",
       "stole over him, and he gradually sank into a sleep, from which he awoke\n",
       "wonderfully refreshed, but perfectly cooled for the time of his passion.\n",
       "This was very baffling to his suit; but then these slumbers were\n",
       "accompanied by agreeable dreams, which completely inthralled the senses\n",
       "of the drowsy lover; so he continued to dream on, while all Granada\n",
       "scoffed at his infatuation, and groaned at the treasures lavished for a\n",

       "At length a danger burst on the head of Aben Habuz, against which his\n",

       "life and the life of his Christian paramour. A spark of his ancient\n",
       "warlike spirit was awakened in the breast of the monarch. At the head of\n",
       "a handful of his guards he sallied forth, put the rebels to flight, and\n",

       "in vain, until, wearied and faint, I laid myself down at noontide, and\n",
       "slept under a palm-tree by the side of a scanty well. When I awoke I\n",

       "with gardens which should rival all related in the Koran of the\n",
       "celestial paradise. But the curse of heaven fell upon him for his\n",
       "presumption. He and his subjects were swept from the earth, and his\n",
       "splendid city, and palace, and gardens, were laid under a perpetual\n",

       "the whole garden had been, as it were, conjured into existence, and by\n",
       "which it was rendered invisible. Such a palace and garden, O king, can\n",
       "I make for thee, even here, on the mountain above thy city. Do I not\n",
       "know all the secret spells? and am I not in possession of the book of\n",

       "the palace.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The monarch gladly agreed to so moderate a stipulation, and the\n",
       "astrologer began his work. On the summit of the hill, immediately above\n",
       "his subterranean hermitage, he caused a great gateway or barbican to be\n",
       "erected, opening through the centre of a strong tower.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was an outer vestibule or porch, with a lofty arch, and within it\n",
       "a portal secured by massive gates. On the keystone of the portal the\n",
       "astrologer, with his own hand, wrought the figure of a huge key; and on\n",
       "the keystone of the outer arch of the vestibule, which was loftier than\n",
       "that of the portal, he carved a gigantic hand. These were potent\n",
       "talismans, over which he repeated many sentences in an unknown tongue.\n",
       "\n",
       "When this gateway was finished, he shut himself up for two days in his\n",
       "astrological hall, engaged in secret incantations; on the third he\n",
       "ascended the hill, and passed the whole day on its summit. At a late\n",
       "hour of the night he came down, and presented himself before Aben Habuz.\n",
       "“At length, O king,” said he, “my labor is accomplished. On the summit\n",
       "of the hill stands one of the most delectable palaces that ever the\n",
       "head of man devised, or the heart of man desired. It contains sumptuous\n",
       "halls and galleries, delicious gardens, cool fountains, and fragrant\n",
       "baths; in a word, the whole mountain is converted into a paradise. Like\n",
       "the garden of Irem, it is protected by a mighty charm, which hides it\n",
       "from the view and search of mortals, excepting such as possess the\n",
       "secret of its talismans.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Enough!” cried Aben Habuz, joyfully, “to-morrow morning with the first\n",
       "light we will ascend and take possession.” The happy monarch slept but\n",
       "little that night. Scarcely had the rays of the sun begun to play about\n",
       "the snowy summit of the Sierra Nevada, when he mounted his steed, and,\n",
       "accompanied only by a few chosen attendants, ascended a steep and narrow\n",
       "road leading up the hill. Beside him, on a white palfrey, rode the\n",
       "Gothic princess, her whole dress sparkling with jewels, while round her\n",
       "neck was suspended her silver lyre. The astrologer walked on the other\n",
       "side of the king, assisting his steps with his hieroglyphic staff, for\n",
       "he never mounted steed of any kind.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aben Habuz looked to see the towers of the palace brightening above him,\n",
       "and the embowered terraces of its gardens stretching along the heights;\n",
       "but as yet nothing of the kind was to be descried. “That is the mystery\n",
       "and safeguard of the place,” said the astrologer, “nothing can be\n",
       "discerned until you have passed the spell-bound gateway, and been put in\n",
       "possession of the place.”\n",
       "\n",
       "As they approached the gateway, the astrologer paused, and pointed out\n",
       "to the king the mystic hand and key carved upon the portal of the arch.\n",
       "“These,” said he, “are the talismans which guard the entrance to this\n",
       "paradise. Until yonder hand shall reach down and seize that key, neither\n",
       "mortal power nor magic artifice can prevail against the lord of this\n",
       "mountain.”\n",
       "\n",
       "While Aben Habuz was gazing, with open mouth and silent wonder, at these\n",
       "mystic talismans, the palfrey of the princess proceeded, and bore her in\n",
       "at the portal, to the very centre of the barbican.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Behold,” cried the astrologer, “my promised reward; the first animal\n",
       "with its burden which should enter the magic gateway.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Aben Habuz smiled at what he considered a pleasantry of the ancient man;\n",
       "but when he found him to be in earnest, his gray beard trembled with\n",
       "indignation.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Son of Abu Ayub,” said he, sternly, “what equivocation is this? Thou\n",
       "knowest the meaning of my promise: the first beast of burden, with its\n",
       "load, that should enter this portal. Take the strongest mule in my\n",
       "stables, load it with the most precious things of my treasury, and it is\n",
       "thine; but dare not raise thy thoughts to her who is the delight of my\n",
       "heart.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What need I of wealth?” cried the astrologer, scornfully; “have I not\n",
       "the book of knowledge of Solomon the Wise, and through it the command of\n",
       "the secret treasures of the earth? The princess is mine by right; thy\n",
       "royal word is pledged; I claim her as my own.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The princess looked down haughtily from her palfrey, and a light smile\n",
       "of scorn curled her rosy lip at this dispute between two gray-beards for\n",
       "the possession of youth and beauty. The wrath of the monarch got the\n",
       "better of his discretion. “Base son of the desert,” cried he, “thou\n",
       "mayst be master of many arts, but know me for thy master, and presume\n",
       "not to juggle with thy king.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“My master! my king!” echoed the astrologer,--“the monarch of a\n",
       "mole-hill to claim sway over him who possesses the talismans of Solomon!\n",
       "Farewell, Aben Habuz; reign over thy petty kingdom, and revel in thy\n",
       "paradise of fools; for me, I will laugh at thee in my philosophic\n",
       "retirement.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So saying, he seized the bridle of the palfrey, smote the earth with his\n",
       "staff, and sank with the Gothic princess through the centre of the\n",
       "barbican. The earth closed over them, and no trace remained of the\n",
       "opening by which they had descended.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aben Habuz was struck dumb for a time with astonishment. Recovering\n",
       "himself, he ordered a thousand workmen to dig, with pickaxe and spade,\n",
       "into the ground where the astrologer had disappeared. They digged and\n",
       "digged, but in vain; the flinty bosom of the hill resisted their\n",
       "implements; or if they did penetrate a little way, the earth filled in\n",
       "again as fast as they threw it out. Aben Habuz sought the mouth of the\n",
       "cavern at the foot of the hill, leading to the subterranean palace of\n",
       "the astrologer; but it was nowhere to be found. Where once had been an\n",
       "entrance, was now a solid surface of primeval rock. With the\n",
       "disappearance of Ibrahim Ebn Abu Ayub ceased the benefit of his\n",
       "talismans. The bronze horseman remained fixed, with his face turned\n",
       "toward the hill, and his spear pointed to the spot where the astrologer\n",
       "had descended, as if there still lurked the deadliest foe of Aben Habuz.\n",
       "\n",
       "From time to time the sound of music, and the tones of a female voice,\n",
       "could be faintly heard from the bosom of the hill; and a peasant one day\n",
       "brought word to the king, that in the preceding night he had found a\n",
       "fissure in the rock, by which he had crept in, until he looked down into\n",
       "a subterranean hall, in which sat the astrologer, on a magnificent\n",
       "divan, slumbering and nodding to the silver lyre of the princess, which\n",
       "seemed to hold a magic sway over his senses.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aben Habuz sought the fissure in the rock, but it was again closed. He\n",
       "renewed the attempt to unearth his rival, but all in vain. The spell of\n",
       "the hand and key was too potent to be counteracted by human power. As to\n",
       "the summit of the mountain, the site of the promised palace and garden,\n",
       "it remained a naked waste; either the boasted elysium was hidden from\n",
       "sight by enchantment, or was a mere fable of the astrologer. The world\n",
       "charitably supposed the latter, and some used to call the place “The\n",
       "King’s Folly”; while others named it “The Fool’s Paradise.”\n",
       "\n",
       "To add to the chagrin of Aben Habuz, the neighbors whom he had defied\n",
       "and taunted, and cut up at his leisure while master of the talismanic\n",
       "horseman, finding him no longer protected by magic spell, made inroads\n",
       "into his territories from all sides, and the remainder of the life of\n",
       "the most pacific of monarchs was a tissue of turmoils.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length Aben Habuz died, and was buried. Ages have since rolled away.\n",
       "The Alhambra has been built on the eventful mountain, and in some\n",
       "measure realizes the fabled delights of the garden of Irem. The\n",
       "spell-bound gateway still exists entire, protected no doubt by the\n",
       "mystic hand and key, and now forms the Gate of Justice, the grand\n",
       "entrance to the fortress. Under that gateway, it is said, the old\n",
       "astrologer remains in his subterranean hall, nodding on his divan,\n",
       "lulled by the silver lyre of the princess.\n",
       "\n",
       "The old invalid sentinels who mount guard at the gate hear the strains\n",
       "occasionally in the summer nights; and, yielding to their soporific\n",
       "power, doze quietly at their posts. Nay, so drowsy an influence pervades\n",

       "of the season had wrought the usual change. On my arrival I had found\n",
       "everything in the freshness of May; the foliage of the trees was still\n",
       "tender and transparent; the pomegranate had not yet shed its brilliant\n",
       "crimson blossoms; the orchards of the Xenil and the Darro were in full\n",
       "bloom; the rocks were hung with wild flowers, and Granada seemed\n",

       "among which the most peculiar is the almost subterranean apartment of\n",
       "the baths. This still retains its ancient Oriental character, though\n",
       "stamped with the touching traces of decline. At the entrance, opening\n",
       "into a small court formerly adorned with flowers, is a hall, moderate in\n",
       "size, but light and graceful in architecture. It is overlooked by a\n",
       "small gallery supported by marble pillars and Moresco arches. An\n",
       "alabaster fountain in the centre of the pavement still throws up a jet\n",
       "of water to cool the place. On each side are deep alcoves with raised\n",

       "cushions, soothed to voluptuous repose by the fragrance of the perfumed\n",

       "among the towers as if the castle had been taken by surprise. On\n",
       "sallying forth, I found an old cavalier with a number of domestics in\n",
       "possession of the Hall of Ambassadors. He was an ancient count who had\n",

       "sportsman, was endeavoring to get an appetite for his breakfast by\n",
       "shooting at swallows from the balconies. It was a harmless amusement;\n",
       "for though, by the alertness of his attendants in loading his pieces, he\n",
       "was enabled to keep up a brisk fire, I could not accuse him of the death\n",
       "of a single swallow. Nay, the birds themselves seemed to enjoy the\n",
       "sport, and to deride his want of skill, skimming in circles close to the\n",
       "balconies, and twittering as they darted by.\n",
       "\n",
       "The arrival of this old gentleman changed essentially the aspect of\n",
       "affairs, but caused no jealousy nor collision. We tacitly shared the\n",
       "empire between us, like the last kings of Granada, excepting that we\n",
       "maintained a most amicable alliance. He reigned absolute over the Court\n",
       "of the Lions and its adjacent halls, while I maintained peaceful\n",
       "possession of the regions of the baths and the little garden of\n",
       "Lindaraxa. We took our meals together under the arcades of the court,\n",

       "from the city accompanied by her step-daughter Carmen, an only child, a\n",
       "charming little being, still in her girlish years. Then there were\n",
       "always some of his official dependants, his chaplain, his lawyer, his\n",
       "secretary, his steward, and other officers and agents of his extensive\n",
       "possessions, who brought him up the news or gossip of the city, and\n",
       "formed his evening party of tresillo or ombre. Thus he held a kind of\n",
       "domestic court, where each one paid him deference, and sought to\n",
       "contribute to his amusement, without, however, any appearance of\n",
       "servility, or any sacrifice of self-respect. In fact, nothing of the\n",
       "kind was exacted by the demeanor of the count; for whatever may be said\n",

       "social or domestic life. Among no people are the relations between\n",
       "kindred more unreserved and cordial, or between superior and dependant\n",
       "more free from haughtiness on the one side, and obsequiousness on the\n",

       "sixteen years of age, and appeared to be considered a mere child, though\n",
       "the idol of the family, going generally by the childlike but endearing\n",
       "appellation of la Niña. Her form had not yet attained full maturity and\n",
       "development, but possessed already the exquisite symmetry and pliant\n",
       "grace so prevalent in this country. Her blue eyes, fair complexion, and\n",
       "light hair were unusual in Andalusia, and gave a mildness and gentleness\n",
       "to her demeanor in contrast to the usual fire of Spanish beauty, but in\n",
       "unison with the guileless and confiding innocence of her manners. She\n",
       "had at the same time the innate aptness and versatility of her\n",
       "fascinating country-women. Whatever she undertook to do she did well and\n",
       "apparently without effort. She sang, played the guitar and other\n",

       "destitute of all ostentatious ornament, as the weapons of great generals\n",

       "usual Oriental type. On the contrary, we have it on the authority of\n",

       "Moslem, was generally abandoned, except in the western provinces, where\n",
       "it continued in use among people of rank and wealth, and those holding\n",

       "perfect prince and a prosperous sovereign. One cloud only rested upon\n",
       "his destiny, and even that was of a roseate hue: he would be of an\n",
       "amorous temperament, and run great perils from the tender passion. If,\n",
       "however, he could be kept from the allurements of love until of mature\n",
       "age, these dangers would be averted, and his life thereafter be one\n",
       "uninterrupted course of felicity.\n",
       "\n",
       "To prevent all danger of the kind, the king wisely determined to rear\n",
       "the prince in a seclusion where he should never see a female face, nor\n",
       "hear even the name of love. For this purpose he built a beautiful palace\n",
       "on the brow of the hill above the Alhambra, in the midst of delightful\n",
       "gardens, but surrounded by lofty walls, being, in fact, the same palace\n",
       "known at the present day by the name of the Generalife. In this palace\n",
       "the youthful prince was shut up, and intrusted to the guardianship and\n",
       "instruction of Eben Bonabben, one of the wisest and dryest of Arabian\n",
       "sages, who had passed the greatest part of his life in Egypt, studying\n",
       "hieroglyphics, and making researches among the tombs and pyramids, and\n",
       "who saw more charms in an Egyptian mummy than in the most tempting of\n",
       "living beauties. The sage was ordered to instruct the prince in all\n",
       "kinds of knowledge but one,--he was to be kept utterly ignorant of love.\n",
       "“Use every precaution for the purpose you may think proper,” said the\n",
       "king, “but remember, O Eben Bonabben, if my son learns aught of that\n",
       "forbidden knowledge while under your care, your head shall answer for\n",
       "it.” A withered smile came over the dry visage of the wise Bonabben at\n",
       "the menace. “Let your majesty’s heart be as easy about your son, as mine\n",
       "is about my head: am I a man likely to give lessons in the idle\n",
       "passion?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Under the vigilant care of the philosopher, the prince grew up in the\n",
       "seclusion of the palace and its gardens. He had black slaves to attend\n",
       "upon him--hideous mutes who knew nothing of love, or if they did, had\n",
       "not words to communicate it. His mental endowments were the peculiar\n",
       "care of Eben Bonabben, who sought to initiate him into the abstruse lore\n",
       "of Egypt; but in this the prince made little progress, and it was soon\n",
       "evident that he had no turn for philosophy.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was, however, amazingly ductile for a youthful prince, ready to\n",
       "follow any advice, and always guided by the last counsellor. He\n",
       "suppressed his yawns, and listened patiently to the long and learned\n",
       "discourses of Eben Bonabben, from which he imbibed a smattering of\n",
       "various kinds of knowledge, and thus happily attained his twentieth\n",
       "year, a miracle of princely wisdom--but totally ignorant of love.\n",
       "\n",
       "About this time, however, a change came over the conduct of the prince.\n",
       "He completely abandoned his studies, and took to strolling about the\n",
       "gardens, and musing by the side of the fountains. He had been taught a\n",
       "little music among his various accomplishments; it now engrossed a great\n",
       "part of his time, and a turn for poetry became apparent. The sage Eben\n",
       "Bonabben took the alarm, and endeavored to work these idle humors out of\n",
       "him by a severe course of algebra; but the prince turned from it with\n",
       "distaste. “I cannot endure algebra,” said he; “it is an abomination to\n",
       "me. I want something that speaks more to the heart.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The sage Eben Bonabben shook his dry head at the words. “Here is an end\n",
       "to philosophy,” thought he. “The prince has discovered he has a heart!”\n",
       "He now kept anxious watch upon his pupil, and saw that the latent\n",
       "tenderness of his nature was in activity, and only wanted an object. He\n",
       "wandered about the gardens of the Generalife in an intoxication of\n",
       "feelings of which he knew not the cause. Sometimes he would sit plunged\n",
       "in a delicious reverie; then he would seize his lute and draw from it\n",
       "the most touching notes, and then throw it aside, and break forth into\n",
       "sighs and ejaculations.\n",
       "\n",
       "By degrees this loving disposition began to extend to inanimate objects;\n",
       "he had his favorite flowers, which he cherished with tender assiduity;\n",
       "then he became attached to various trees, and there was one in\n",
       "particular, of a graceful form and drooping foliage, on which he\n",
       "lavished his amorous devotion, carving his name on its bark, hanging\n",
       "garlands on its branches, and singing couplets in its praise, to the\n",
       "accompaniment of his lute.\n",
       "\n",
       "Eben Bonabben was alarmed at this excited state of his pupil. He saw him\n",
       "on the very brink of forbidden knowledge--the least hint might reveal to\n",
       "him the fatal secret. Trembling for the safety of the prince and the\n",
       "security of his own head, he hastened to draw him from the seductions of\n",
       "the garden, and shut him up in the highest tower of the Generalife. It\n",
       "contained beautiful apartments, and commanded an almost boundless\n",
       "prospect, but was elevated far above that atmosphere of sweets and those\n",
       "witching bowers so dangerous to the feelings of the too susceptible\n",
       "Ahmed.\n",
       "\n",
       "What was to be done, however, to reconcile him to this restraint and to\n",
       "beguile the tedious hours? He had exhausted almost all kinds of\n",
       "agreeable knowledge; and algebra was not to be mentioned. Fortunately\n",
       "Eben Bonabben had been instructed, when in Egypt, in the language of\n",
       "birds by a Jewish Rabbin, who had received it in lineal transmission\n",
       "from Solomon the Wise, who had been taught it by the queen of Sheba. At\n",
       "the very mention of such a study, the eyes of the prince sparkled with\n",
       "animation, and he applied himself to it with such avidity, that he soon\n",
       "became as great an adept as his master.\n",
       "\n",
       "The tower of the Generalife was no longer a solitude; he had companions\n",
       "at hand with whom he could converse. The first acquaintance he formed\n",
       "was with a hawk, who built his nest in a crevice of the lofty\n",
       "battlements, whence he soared far and wide in quest of prey. The prince,\n",
       "however, found little to like or esteem in him. He was a mere pirate of\n",
       "the air, swaggering and boastful, whose talk was all about rapine and\n",
       "carnage, and desperate exploits.\n",
       "\n",
       "His next acquaintance was an owl, a mighty wise-looking bird, with a\n",
       "huge head and staring eyes, who sat blinking and goggling all day in a\n",
       "hole in the wall, but roamed forth at night. He had great pretensions to\n",
       "wisdom, talked something of astrology and the moon, and hinted at the\n",
       "dark sciences; he was grievously given to metaphysics, and the prince\n",
       "found his prosings even more ponderous than those of the sage Eben\n",
       "Bonabben.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then there was a bat, that hung all day by his heels in the dark corner\n",
       "of a vault, but sallied out in slipshod style at twilight. He, however,\n",
       "had but twilight ideas on all subjects, derided things of which he had\n",
       "taken but an imperfect view, and seemed to take delight in nothing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Besides these there was a swallow, with whom the prince was at first\n",
       "much taken. He was a smart talker, but restless, bustling, and forever\n",
       "on the wing; seldom remaining long enough for any continued\n",
       "conversation. He turned out in the end to be a mere smatterer, who did\n",
       "but skim over the surface of things, pretending to know everything, but\n",
       "knowing nothing thoroughly.\n",
       "\n",
       "These were the only feathered associates with whom the prince had any\n",
       "opportunity of exercising his newly acquired language; the tower was too\n",
       "high for any other birds to frequent it. He soon grew weary of his new\n",
       "acquaintances, whose conversation spoke so little to the head and\n",
       "nothing to the heart, and gradually relapsed into his loneliness. A\n",
       "winter passed away, spring opened with all its bloom and verdure and\n",
       "breathing sweetness, and the happy time arrived for birds to pair and\n",
       "build their nests. Suddenly, as it were, a universal burst of song and\n",
       "melody broke forth from the groves and gardens of the Generalife, and\n",
       "reached the prince in the solitude of his tower. From every side he\n",
       "heard the same universal theme--love--love--love--chanted forth, and\n",
       "responded to it in every variety of note and tone. The prince listened\n",
       "in silence and perplexity. “What can be this love,” thought he, “of\n",
       "which the world seems so full, and of which I know nothing?” He applied\n",
       "for information to his friend the hawk. The ruffian bird answered in a\n",
       "tone of scorn: “You must apply,” said he, “to the vulgar peaceable\n",
       "birds of earth, who are made for the prey of us princes of the air. My\n",
       "trade is war, and fighting my delight. I am a warrior, and know nothing\n",
       "of this thing called love.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince turned from him with disgust, and sought the owl in his\n",
       "retreat. “This is a bird,” said he, “of peaceful habits, and may be able\n",
       "to solve my question.” So he asked the owl to tell him what was this\n",
       "love about which all the birds in the groves below were singing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon this the owl put on a look of offended dignity. “My nights,” said\n",
       "he, “are taken up in study and research, and my days in ruminating in my\n",
       "cell upon all that I have learnt. As to these singing birds of whom you\n",
       "talk, I never listen to them--I despise them and their themes. Allah be\n",
       "praised, I cannot sing; I am a philosopher, and know nothing of this\n",
       "thing called love.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince now repaired to the vault, where his friend the bat was\n",
       "hanging by the heels, and propounded the same question. The bat wrinkled\n",
       "up his nose into a most snappish expression. “Why do you disturb me in\n",
       "my morning’s nap with such an idle question?” said he, peevishly. “I\n",
       "only fly by twilight, when all birds are asleep, and never trouble\n",
       "myself with their concerns. I am neither bird nor beast, and I thank\n",
       "heaven for it. I have found out the villany of the whole of them, and\n",
       "hate them one and all. In a word, I am a misanthrope--and know nothing\n",
       "of this thing called love.”\n",
       "\n",
       "As a last resort, the prince now sought the swallow, and stopped him\n",
       "just as he was circling about the summit of the tower. The swallow, as\n",
       "usual, was in a prodigious hurry, and had scarce time to make a reply.\n",
       "“Upon my word,” said he, “I have so much public business to attend to,\n",
       "and so many pursuits to follow, that I have had no time to think on the\n",
       "subject. I have every day a thousand visits to pay; a thousand affairs\n",
       "of importance to examine into, that leave me not a moment of leisure for\n",
       "these little sing-song matters. In a word, I am a citizen of the\n",
       "world--I know nothing of this thing called love.” So saying, the swallow\n",
       "dived into the valley, and was out of sight in a moment.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince remained disappointed and perplexed, but with his curiosity\n",
       "still more piqued by the difficulty of gratifying it. While in this\n",
       "mood, his ancient guardian entered the tower. The prince advanced\n",
       "eagerly to meet him. “O Eben Bonabben,” cried he, “thou hast revealed to\n",
       "me much of the wisdom of the earth; but there is one thing of which I\n",
       "remain in utter ignorance, and would fain be informed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“My prince has but to make the inquiry, and everything within the\n",
       "limited range of his servant’s intellect is at his command.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tell me then, O most profound of sages, what is the nature of this\n",
       "thing called love?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Eben Bonabben was struck as with a thunderbolt. He trembled and turned\n",
       "pale, and felt as if his head sat but loosely on his shoulders.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What could suggest such a question to my prince,--where could he have\n",
       "learnt so idle a word?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince led him to the window of the tower. “Listen, O Eben\n",
       "Bonabben,” said he. The sage listened. The nightingale sat in a thicket\n",
       "below the tower, singing to his paramour the rose; from every\n",
       "blossomed spray and tufted grove rose a strain of melody; and\n",
       "love--love--love--was still the unvarying strain.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Allah Akbar! God is great!” exclaimed the wise Bonabben. “Who shall\n",
       "pretend to keep this secret from the heart of man, when even the birds\n",
       "of the air conspire to betray it?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then turning to Ahmed--“O my prince,” cried he, “shut thine ears to\n",
       "these seductive strains. Close thy mind against this dangerous\n",
       "knowledge. Know that this love is the cause of half the ills of wretched\n",
       "mortality. It is this which produces bitterness and strife between\n",
       "brethren and friends; which causes treacherous murder and desolating\n",
       "war. Care and sorrow, weary days and sleepless nights, are its\n",
       "attendants. It withers the bloom and blights the joy of youth, and\n",
       "brings on the ills and griefs of premature old age. Allah preserve thee,\n",
       "my prince, in total ignorance of this thing called love!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The sage Eben Bonabben hastily retired, leaving the prince plunged in\n",
       "still deeper perplexity. It was in vain he attempted to dismiss the\n",
       "subject from his mind; it still continued uppermost in his thoughts, and\n",
       "teased and exhausted him with vain conjectures. Surely, said he to\n",
       "himself, as he listened to the tuneful strains of the birds, there is no\n",
       "sorrow in those notes; everything seems tenderness and joy. If love be a\n",
       "cause of such wretchedness and strife, why are not these birds drooping\n",
       "in solitude, or tearing each other in pieces, instead of fluttering\n",
       "cheerfully about the groves, or sporting with each other among flowers?\n",
       "\n",
       "He lay one morning on his couch, meditating on this inexplicable matter.\n",
       "The window of his chamber was open to admit the soft morning breeze,\n",
       "which came laden with the perfume of orange-blossoms from the valley of\n",
       "the Darro. The voice of the nightingale was faintly heard, still\n",
       "chanting the wonted theme. As the prince was listening and sighing,\n",
       "there was a sudden rushing noise in the air; a beautiful dove, pursued\n",
       "by a hawk, darted in at the window, and fell panting on the floor, while\n",
       "the pursuer, balked of his prey, soared off to the mountains.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince took up the gasping bird, smoothed its feathers, and nestled\n",
       "it in his bosom. When he had soothed it by his caresses, he put it in a\n",
       "golden cage, and offered it, with his own hands, the whitest and finest\n",
       "of wheat and the purest of water. The bird, however, refused food, and\n",
       "sat drooping and pining, and uttering piteous moans.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What aileth thee?” said Ahmed. “Hast thou not everything thy heart can\n",
       "wish?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Alas, no!” replied the dove; “am I not separated from the partner of my\n",
       "heart, and that too in the happy spring-time, the very season of love!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Of love!” echoed Ahmed. “I pray thee, my pretty bird, canst thou then\n",
       "tell me what is love?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Too well can I, my prince. It is the torment of one, the felicity of\n",
       "two, the strife and enmity of three. It is a charm which draws two\n",
       "beings together, and unites them by delicious sympathies, making it\n",
       "happiness to be with each other, but misery to be apart. Is there no\n",
       "being to whom you are drawn by these ties of tender affection?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I like my old teacher Eben Bonabben better than any other being; but he\n",
       "is often tedious, and I occasionally feel myself happier without his\n",
       "society.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That is not the sympathy I mean. I speak of love, the great mystery and\n",
       "principle of life; the intoxicating revel of youth; the sober delight of\n",
       "age. Look forth, my prince, and behold how at this blest season all\n",
       "nature is full of love. Every created being has its mate; the most\n",
       "insignificant bird sings to its paramour; the very beetle wooes its\n",
       "lady-beetle in the dust, and yon butterflies which you see fluttering\n",
       "high above the tower and toying in the air, are happy in each other’s\n",
       "loves. Alas, my prince! hast thou spent so many of the precious days of\n",
       "youth without knowing anything of love? Is there no gentle being of\n",
       "another sex--no beautiful princess nor lovely damsel who has ensnared\n",
       "your heart, and filled your bosom with a soft tumult of pleasing pains\n",
       "and tender wishes?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I begin to understand,” said the prince, sighing; “such a tumult I have\n",
       "more than once experienced, without knowing the cause; and where should\n",
       "I seek for an object such as you describe, in this dismal solitude?”\n",
       "\n",
       "A little further conversation ensued, and the first amatory lesson of\n",
       "the prince was complete.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Alas!” said he, “if love be indeed such a delight, and its interruption\n",
       "such a misery, Allah forbid that I should mar the joy of any of its\n",
       "votaries.” He opened the cage, took out the dove, and having fondly\n",
       "kissed it, carried it to the window. “Go, happy bird,” said he, “rejoice\n",
       "with the partner of thy heart in the days of youth and spring-time. Why\n",
       "should I make thee a fellow-prisoner in this dreary tower, where love\n",
       "can never enter?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The dove flapped its wings in rapture, gave one vault into the air, and\n",
       "then swooped downward on whistling wings to the blooming bowers of the\n",
       "Darro.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince followed him with his eyes, and then gave way to bitter\n",
       "repining. The singing of the birds, which once delighted him, now added\n",
       "to his bitterness. Love! love! love! Alas, poor youth! he now understood\n",
       "the strain.\n",
       "\n",
       "His eyes flashed fire when next he beheld the sage Bonabben. “Why hast\n",
       "thou kept me in this abject ignorance?” cried he. “Why has the great\n",
       "mystery and principle of life been withheld from me, in which I find the\n",
       "meanest insect is so learned? Behold all nature is in a revel of\n",
       "delight. Every created being rejoices with its mate. This--this is the\n",
       "love about which I have sought instruction. Why am I alone debarred its\n",
       "enjoyment? Why has so much of my youth been wasted without a knowledge\n",
       "of its raptures?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The sage Bonabben saw that all further reserve was useless; for the\n",
       "prince had acquired the dangerous and forbidden knowledge. He revealed\n",
       "to him, therefore, the predictions of the astrologers, and the\n",
       "precautions that had been taken in his education to avert the threatened\n",
       "evils. “And now, my prince,” added he, “my life is in your hands. Let\n",
       "the king your father discover that you have learned the passion of love\n",
       "while under my guardianship, and my head must answer for it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince was as reasonable as most young men of his age, and easily\n",
       "listened to the remonstrances of his tutor, since nothing pleaded\n",
       "against them. Besides, he really was attached to Eben Bonabben, and\n",
       "being as yet but theoretically acquainted with the passion of love, he\n",
       "consented to confine the knowledge of it to his own bosom, rather than\n",
       "endanger the head of the philosopher.\n",
       "\n",
       "His discretion was doomed, however, to be put to still further proofs. A\n",
       "few mornings afterwards, as he was ruminating on the battlements of the\n",
       "tower, the dove which had been released by him came hovering in the air,\n",
       "and alighted fearlessly upon his shoulder.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince fondled it to his heart. “Happy bird,” said he, “who can fly,\n",
       "as it were, with the wings of the morning to the uttermost parts of the\n",
       "earth. Where hast thou been since we parted?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“In a far country, my prince, whence I bring you tidings in reward for\n",
       "my liberty. In the wild compass of my flight, which extends over plain\n",
       "and mountain, as I was soaring in the air, I beheld below me a\n",
       "delightful garden with all kinds of fruits and flowers. It was in a\n",
       "green meadow, on the banks of a wandering stream; and in the centre of\n",
       "the garden was a stately palace. I alighted in one of the bowers to\n",
       "repose after my weary flight. On the green bank below me was a youthful\n",
       "princess, in the very sweetness and bloom of her years. She was\n",
       "surrounded by female attendants, young like herself, who decked her\n",
       "with garlands and coronets of flowers; but no flower of field or garden\n",
       "could compare with her for loveliness. Here, however, she bloomed in\n",
       "secret, for the garden was surrounded by high walls, and no mortal man\n",
       "was permitted to enter. When I beheld this beauteous maid, thus young\n",
       "and innocent and unspotted by the world, I thought, here is the being\n",
       "formed by heaven to inspire my prince with love.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The description was a spark of fire to the combustible heart of Ahmed;\n",
       "all the latent amorousness of his temperament had at once found an\n",
       "object, and he conceived an immeasurable passion for the princess. He\n",
       "wrote a letter, couched in the most impassioned language, breathing his\n",
       "fervent devotion, but bewailing the unhappy thraldom of his person,\n",
       "which prevented him from seeking her out and throwing himself at her\n",
       "feet. He added couplets of the most tender and moving eloquence, for he\n",
       "was a poet by nature, and inspired by love. He addressed his letter--“To\n",
       "the Unknown Beauty, from the captive Prince Ahmed”; then perfuming it\n",
       "with musk and roses, he gave it to the dove.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Away, trustiest of messengers!” said he. “Fly over mountain, and\n",
       "valley, and river, and plain; rest not in bower, nor set foot on earth,\n",
       "until thou hast given this letter to the mistress of my heart.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The dove soared high in air, and taking his course darted away in one\n",
       "undeviating direction. The prince followed him with his eye until he was\n",
       "a mere speck on a cloud, and gradually disappeared behind a mountain.\n",
       "\n",
       "Day after day he watched for the return of the messenger of love, but he\n",
       "watched in vain. He began to accuse him of forgetfulness, when towards\n",
       "sunset one evening the faithful bird fluttered into his apartment, and\n",
       "falling at his feet expired. The arrow of some wanton archer had pierced\n",
       "his breast, yet he had struggled with the lingerings of life to execute\n",
       "his mission. As the prince bent with grief over this gentle martyr to\n",
       "fidelity, he beheld a chain of pearls round his neck, attached to which,\n",
       "beneath his wing, was a small enamelled picture. It represented a lovely\n",
       "princess in the very flower of her years. It was doubtless the unknown\n",
       "beauty of the garden; but who and where was she?--how had she received\n",
       "his letter? and was this picture sent as a token of her approval of his\n",
       "passion? Unfortunately the death of the faithful dove left everything in\n",
       "mystery and doubt.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince gazed on the picture till his eyes swam with tears. He\n",
       "pressed it to his lips and to his heart; he sat for hours contemplating\n",
       "it almost in an agony of tenderness. “Beautiful image!” said he, “alas,\n",
       "thou art but an image! Yet thy dewy eyes beam tenderly upon me; those\n",
       "rosy lips look as though they would speak encouragement: vain fancies!\n",
       "Have they not looked the same on some more happy rival? But where in\n",
       "this wide world shall I hope to find the original? Who knows what\n",
       "mountains, what realms may separate us; what adverse chances may\n",
       "intervene? Perhaps now, even now, lovers may be crowding around her,\n",
       "while I sit here a prisoner in a tower, wasting my time in adoration of\n",
       "a painted shadow.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The resolution of Prince Ahmed was taken. “I will fly from this palace,”\n",
       "said he, “which has become an odious prison; and, a pilgrim of love,\n",
       "will seek this unknown princess throughout the world.” To escape from\n",
       "the tower in the day, when every one was awake, might be a difficult\n",
       "matter; but at night the palace was slightly guarded; for no one\n",
       "apprehended any attempt of the kind from the prince, who had always been\n",
       "so passive in his captivity. How was he to guide himself, however, in\n",
       "his darkling flight, being ignorant of the country? He bethought him of\n",
       "the owl, who was accustomed to roam at night, and must know every\n",
       "by-lane and secret pass. Seeking him in his hermitage, he questioned him\n",
       "touching his knowledge of the land. Upon this the owl put on a mighty\n",
       "self-important look. “You must know, O prince,” said he, “that we owls\n",
       "are of a very ancient and extensive family, though rather fallen to\n",
       "decay, and possess ruinous castles and palaces in all parts of Spain.\n",
       "There is scarcely a tower of the mountains, or a fortress of the plains,\n",
       "or an old citadel of a city, but has some brother, or uncle, or cousin,\n",
       "quartered in it; and in going the rounds to visit this my numerous\n",
       "kindred, I have pried into every nook and corner, and made myself\n",
       "acquainted with every secret of the land.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince was overjoyed to find the owl so deeply versed in topography,\n",
       "and now informed him, in confidence, of his tender passion and his\n",
       "intended elopement, urging him to be his companion and counsellor.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Go to!” said the owl, with a look of displeasure; “am I a bird to\n",
       "engage in a love-affair?--I, whose whole time is devoted to meditation\n",
       "and the moon?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Be not offended, most solemn owl,” replied the prince; “abstract\n",
       "thyself for a time from meditation and the moon, and aid me in my\n",
       "flight, and thou shalt have whatever heart can wish.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I have that already,” said the owl: “a few mice are sufficient for my\n",
       "frugal table, and this hole in the wall is spacious enough for my\n",
       "studies; and what more does a philosopher like myself desire?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bethink thee, most wise owl, that while moping in thy cell and gazing\n",
       "at the moon, all thy talents are lost to the world. I shall one day be a\n",
       "sovereign prince, and may advance thee to some post of honor and\n",
       "dignity.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The owl, though a philosopher and above the ordinary wants of life, was\n",
       "not above ambition; so he was finally prevailed on to elope with the\n",
       "prince, and be his guide and mentor in his pilgrimage.\n",
       "\n",
       "The plans of a lover are promptly executed. The prince collected all his\n",
       "jewels, and concealed them about his person as travelling funds. That\n",
       "very night he lowered himself by his scarf from a balcony of the tower,\n",
       "clambered over the outer walls of the Generalife, and, guided by the\n",
       "owl, made good his escape before morning to the mountains.\n",
       "\n",
       "He now held a council with his mentor as to his future course.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Might I advise,” said the owl, “I would recommend you to repair to\n",
       "Seville. You must know that many years since I was on a visit to an\n",
       "uncle, an owl of great dignity and power, who lived in a ruined wing of\n",
       "the Alcazar of that place. In my hoverings at night over the city I\n",
       "frequently remarked a light burning in a lonely tower. At length I\n",
       "alighted on the battlements, and found it to proceed from the lamp of an\n",
       "Arabian magician: he was surrounded by his magic books, and on his\n",
       "shoulder was perched his familiar, an ancient raven who had come with\n",
       "him from Egypt. I am acquainted with that raven, and owe to him a great\n",
       "part of the knowledge I possess. The magician is since dead, but the\n",
       "raven still inhabits the tower, for these birds are of wonderful long\n",
       "life. I would advise you, O prince, to seek that raven, for he is a\n",
       "soothsayer and a conjurer, and deals in the black art, for which all\n",
       "ravens, and especially those of Egypt, are renowned.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince was struck with the wisdom of this advice, and accordingly\n",
       "bent his course towards Seville. He travelled only in the night, to\n",
       "accommodate his companion, and lay by during the day in some dark cavern\n",
       "or mouldering watch-tower, for the owl knew every hiding-hole of the\n",
       "kind, and had a most antiquarian taste for ruins.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length one morning at daybreak they reached the city of Seville,\n",
       "where the owl, who hated the glare and bustle of crowded streets,\n",
       "halted without the gate, and took up his quarters in a hollow tree.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince entered the gate, and readily found the magic tower, which\n",
       "rose above the houses of the city, as a palm-tree rises above the shrubs\n",
       "of the desert; it was in fact the same tower standing at the present\n",
       "day, and known as the Giralda, the famous Moorish tower of Seville.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince ascended by a great winding staircase to the summit of the\n",
       "tower, where he found the cabalistic raven,--an old, mysterious,\n",
       "gray-headed bird, ragged in feather, with a film over one eye that gave\n",
       "him the glare of a spectre. He was perched on one leg, with his head\n",
       "turned on one side, poring with his remaining eye on a diagram described\n",
       "on the pavement.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince approached him with the awe and reverence naturally inspired\n",
       "by his venerable appearance and supernatural wisdom. “Pardon me, most\n",
       "ancient and darkly wise raven,” exclaimed he, “if for a moment I\n",
       "interrupt those studies which are the wonder of the world. You behold\n",
       "before you a votary of love, who would fain seek your counsel how to\n",
       "obtain the object of his passion.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“In other words,” said the raven, with a significant look, “you seek to\n",
       "try my skill in palmistry. Come, show me your hand, and let me decipher\n",
       "the mysterious lines of fortune.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Excuse me,” said the prince, “I come not to pry into the decrees of\n",
       "fate, which are hidden by Allah from the eyes of mortals; I am a pilgrim\n",
       "of love, and seek but to find a clue to the object of my pilgrimage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And can you be at any loss for an object in amorous Andalusia?” said\n",
       "the old raven, leering upon him with his single eye; “above all, can you\n",
       "be at a loss in wanton Seville, where black-eyed damsels dance the\n",
       "zambra under every orange grove?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince blushed, and was somewhat shocked at hearing an old bird with\n",
       "one foot in the grave talk thus loosely. “Believe me,” said he, gravely,\n",
       "“I am on none such light and vagrant errand as thou dost insinuate. The\n",
       "black-eyed damsels of Andalusia who dance among the orange groves of the\n",
       "Guadalquivir are as naught to me. I seek one unknown but immaculate\n",
       "beauty, the original of this picture; and I beseech thee, most potent\n",
       "raven, if it be within the scope of thy knowledge or the reach of thy\n",
       "art, inform me where she may be found.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The gray-headed raven was rebuked by the gravity of the prince.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What know I,” replied he, dryly, “of youth and beauty? my visits are to\n",
       "the old and withered, not the fresh and fair: the harbinger of fate am\n",
       "I; who croak bodings of death from the chimney-top, and flap my wings at\n",
       "the sick man’s window. You must seek elsewhere for tidings of your\n",
       "unknown beauty.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And where can I seek if not among the sons of wisdom, versed in the\n",
       "book of destiny? Know that I am a royal prince, fated by the stars, and\n",
       "sent on a mysterious enterprise on which may hang the destiny of\n",
       "empires.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When the raven heard that it was a matter of vast moment, in which the\n",
       "stars took interest, he changed his tone and manner, and listened with\n",
       "profound attention to the story of the prince. When it was concluded, he\n",
       "replied, “Touching this princess, I can give thee no information of\n",
       "myself, for my flight is not among gardens, or around ladies’ bowers;\n",
       "but hie thee to Cordova, seek the palm-tree of the great Abderahman,\n",
       "which stands in the court of the principal mosque: at the foot of it\n",
       "thou wilt find a great traveller who has visited all countries and\n",
       "courts, and been a favorite with queens and princesses. He will give\n",
       "thee tidings of the object of thy search.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Many thanks for this precious information,” said the prince. “Farewell,\n",
       "most venerable conjurer.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Farewell, pilgrim of love,” said the raven, dryly, and again fell to\n",
       "pondering on the diagram.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince sallied forth from Seville, sought his fellow-traveller the\n",
       "owl, who was still dozing in the hollow tree, and set off for Cordova.\n",
       "\n",
       "He approached it along hanging gardens, and orange and citron groves,\n",
       "overlooking the fair valley of the Guadalquivir. When arrived at its\n",
       "gates the owl flew up to a dark hole in the wall, and the prince\n",
       "proceeded in quest of the palm-tree planted in days of yore by the great\n",
       "Abderahman. It stood in the midst of the great court of the mosque,\n",
       "towering from amidst orange and cypress trees. Dervises and Faquirs were\n",
       "seated in groups under the cloisters of the court, and many of the\n",
       "faithful were performing their ablutions at the fountains before\n",
       "entering the mosque.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the foot of the palm-tree was a crowd listening to the words of one\n",
       "who appeared to be talking with great volubility. “This,” said the\n",
       "prince to himself, “must be the great traveller who is to give me\n",
       "tidings of the unknown princess.” He mingled in the crowd, but was\n",
       "astonished to perceive that they were all listening to a parrot, who\n",
       "with his bright-green coat, pragmatical eye, and consequential top-knot,\n",
       "had the air of a bird on excellent terms with himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "“How is this,” said the prince to one of the bystanders, “that so many\n",
       "grave persons can be delighted with the garrulity of a chattering bird?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“You know not whom you speak of,” said the other; “this parrot is a\n",
       "descendant of the famous parrot of Persia, renowned for his\n",
       "story-telling talent. He has all the learning of the East at the tip of\n",
       "his tongue, and can quote poetry as fast as he can talk. He has visited\n",
       "various foreign courts, where he has been considered an oracle of\n",
       "erudition. He has been a universal favorite also with the fair sex, who\n",
       "have a vast admiration for erudite parrots that can quote poetry.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Enough,” said the prince, “I will have some private talk with this\n",
       "distinguished traveller.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He sought a private interview, and expounded the nature of his errand.\n",
       "He had scarcely mentioned it when the parrot burst into a fit of dry\n",
       "rickety laughter, that absolutely brought tears into his eyes. “Excuse\n",
       "my merriment,” said he, “but the mere mention of love always sets me\n",
       "laughing.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince was shocked at this ill-timed mirth. “Is not love,” said he,\n",
       "“the great mystery of nature, the secret principle of life, the\n",
       "universal bond of sympathy?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A fig’s end!” cried the parrot, interrupting him; “prithee where hast\n",
       "thou learned this sentimental jargon? trust me, love is quite out of\n",
       "vogue; one never hears of it in the company of wits and people of\n",
       "refinement.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince sighed as he recalled the different language of his friend\n",
       "the dove. But this parrot, thought he, has lived about the court, he\n",
       "affects the wit and the fine gentleman, he knows nothing of the thing\n",
       "called love. Unwilling to provoke any more ridicule of the sentiment\n",
       "which filled his heart, he now directed his inquiries to the immediate\n",
       "purport of his visit.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tell me,” said he, “most accomplished parrot, thou who hast everywhere\n",
       "been admitted to the most secret bowers of beauty, hast thou in the\n",
       "course of thy travels met with the original of this portrait?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The parrot took the picture in his claw, turned his head from side to\n",
       "side, and examined it curiously with either eye. “Upon my honor,” said\n",
       "he, “a very pretty face, very pretty; but then one sees so many pretty\n",
       "women in one’s travels that one can hardly--but hold--bless me! now I\n",
       "look at it again--sure enough, this is the Princess Aldegonda: how could\n",
       "I forget one that is so prodigious a favorite with me!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“The Princess Aldegonda!” echoed the prince; “and where is she to be\n",
       "found?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Softly, softly,” said the parrot, “easier to be found than gained. She\n",
       "is the only daughter of the Christian king who reigns at Toledo, and is\n",
       "shut up from the world until her seventeenth birthday, on account of\n",
       "some prediction of those meddlesome fellows the astrologers. You’ll not\n",
       "get a sight of her; no mortal man can see her. I was admitted to her\n",
       "presence to entertain her, and I assure you, on the word of a parrot who\n",
       "has seen the world, I have conversed with much sillier princesses in my\n",
       "time.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A word in confidence, my dear parrot,” said the prince. “I am heir to a\n",
       "kingdom, and shall one day sit upon a throne. I see that you are a bird\n",
       "of parts, and understand the world. Help me to gain possession of this\n",
       "princess, and I will advance you to some distinguished place about\n",
       "court.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“With all my heart,” said the parrot; “but let it be a sinecure if\n",
       "possible, for we wits have a great dislike to labor.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Arrangements were promptly made: the prince sallied forth from Cordova\n",
       "through the same gate by which he had entered; called the owl down from\n",
       "the hole in the wall, introduced him to his new travelling companion as\n",
       "a brother savant, and away they set off on their journey.\n",
       "\n",
       "They travelled much more slowly than accorded with the impatience of the\n",
       "prince; but the parrot was accustomed to high life, and did not like to\n",
       "be disturbed early in the morning. The owl, on the other hand, was for\n",
       "sleeping at mid-day, and lost a great deal of time by his long siestas.\n",
       "His antiquarian taste also was in the way; for he insisted on pausing\n",
       "and inspecting every ruin, and had long legendary tales to tell about\n",
       "every old tower and castle in the country. The prince had supposed that\n",
       "he and the parrot, being both birds of learning, would delight in each\n",
       "other’s society, but never had he been more mistaken. They were\n",
       "eternally bickering. The one was a wit, the other a philosopher. The\n",
       "parrot quoted poetry, was critical on new readings and eloquent on small\n",
       "points of erudition; the owl treated all such knowledge as trifling, and\n",
       "relished nothing but metaphysics. Then the parrot would sing songs and\n",
       "repeat _bon mots_ and crack jokes upon his solemn neighbor, and laugh\n",
       "outrageously at his own wit; all which proceedings the owl considered as\n",
       "a grievous invasion of his dignity, and would scowl and sulk and swell,\n",
       "and be silent for a whole day together.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince heeded not the wranglings of his companions, being wrapped up\n",
       "in the dreams of his own fancy and the contemplation of the portrait of\n",
       "the beautiful princess. In this way they journeyed through the stern\n",
       "passes of the Sierra Morena, across the sunburnt plains of La Mancha and\n",
       "Castile, and along the banks of the “Golden Tagus,” which winds its\n",
       "wizard mazes over one half of Spain and Portugal. At length they came in\n",
       "sight of a strong city with walls and towers built on a rocky\n",
       "promontory, round the foot of which the Tagus circled with brawling\n",
       "violence.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Behold,” exclaimed the owl, “the ancient and renowned city of Toledo; a\n",
       "city famous for its antiquities. Behold those venerable domes and\n",
       "towers, hoary with time and clothed with legendary grandeur, in which so\n",
       "many of my ancestors have meditated.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Pish!” cried the parrot, interrupting his solemn antiquarian rapture,\n",
       "“what have we to do with antiquities, and legends, and your ancestry?\n",
       "Behold what is more to the purpose--behold the abode of youth and\n",
       "beauty--behold at length, O prince, the abode of your long-sought\n",
       "princess.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince looked in the direction indicated by the parrot, and beheld,\n",
       "in a delightful green meadow on the banks of the Tagus, a stately\n",
       "palace rising from amidst the bowers of a delicious garden. It was just\n",
       "such a place as had been described by the dove as the residence of the\n",
       "original of the picture. He gazed at it with a throbbing heart; “perhaps\n",
       "at this moment,” thought he, “the beautiful princess is sporting beneath\n",
       "those shady bowers, or pacing with delicate step those stately terraces,\n",
       "or reposing beneath those lofty roofs!” As he looked more narrowly, he\n",
       "perceived that the walls of the garden were of great height, so as to\n",
       "defy access, while numbers of armed guards patrolled around them.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince turned to the parrot. “O most accomplished of birds,” said\n",
       "he, “thou hast the gift of human speech. Hie thee to yon garden; seek\n",
       "the idol of my soul, and tell her that Prince Ahmed, a pilgrim of love,\n",
       "and guided by the stars, has arrived in quest of her on the flowery\n",
       "banks of the Tagus.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The parrot, proud of his embassy, flew away to the garden, mounted above\n",
       "its lofty walls, and after soaring for a time over the lawns and groves,\n",
       "alighted on the balcony of a pavilion that overhung the river. Here,\n",
       "looking in at the casement, he beheld the princess reclining on a couch,\n",
       "with her eyes fixed on a paper, while tears gently stole after each\n",
       "other down her pallid cheek.\n",
       "\n",
       "Pluming his wings for a moment, adjusting his bright-green coat, and\n",
       "elevating his top-knot, the parrot perched himself beside her with a\n",
       "gallant air; then assuming a tenderness of tone, “Dry thy tears, most\n",
       "beautiful of princesses,” said he; “I come to bring solace to thy\n",
       "heart.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The princess was startled on hearing a voice, but turning and seeing\n",
       "nothing but a little green-coated bird bobbing and bowing before her,\n",
       "“Alas! what solace canst thou yield,” said she, “seeing thou art but a\n",
       "parrot?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The parrot was nettled at the question. “I have consoled many beautiful\n",
       "ladies in my time,” said he; “but let that pass. At present I come\n",
       "ambassador from a royal prince. Know that Ahmed, the prince of Granada,\n",
       "has arrived in quest of thee, and is encamped even now on the flowery\n",
       "banks of the Tagus.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The eyes of the beautiful princess sparkled at these words even brighter\n",
       "than the diamonds in her coronet. “O sweetest of parrots,” cried she,\n",
       "“joyful indeed are thy tidings, for I was faint and weary, and sick\n",
       "almost unto death with doubt of the constancy of Ahmed. Hie thee back,\n",
       "and tell him that the words of his letter are engraven in my heart, and\n",
       "his poetry has been the food of my soul. Tell him, however, that he must\n",
       "prepare to prove his love by force of arms; to-morrow is my seventeenth\n",
       "birthday, when the king my father holds a great tournament; several\n",
       "princes are to enter the lists, and my hand is to be the prize of the\n",
       "victor.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The parrot again took wing, and rustling through the groves, flew back\n",
       "to where the prince awaited his return. The rapture of Ahmed on finding\n",
       "the original of his adored portrait, and finding her kind and true, can\n",
       "only be conceived by those favored mortals who have had the good fortune\n",
       "to realize day-dreams and turn a shadow into substance: still there was\n",
       "one thing that alloyed his transport--this impending tournament. In\n",
       "fact, the banks of the Tagus were already glittering with arms, and\n",
       "resounding with trumpets of the various knights, who, with proud\n",
       "retinues, were prancing on towards Toledo to attend the ceremonial. The\n",
       "same star that had controlled the destiny of the prince had governed\n",
       "that of the princess, and until her seventeenth birthday she had been\n",
       "shut up from the world, to guard her from the tender passion. The fame\n",
       "of her charms, however, had been enhanced rather than obscured by this\n",
       "seclusion. Several powerful princes had contended for her hand; and her\n",
       "father, who was a king of wondrous shrewdness, to avoid making enemies\n",
       "by showing partiality, had referred them to the arbitrament of arms.\n",
       "Among the rival candidates were several renowned for strength and\n",
       "prowess. What a predicament for the unfortunate Ahmed, unprovided as he\n",
       "was with weapons, and unskilled in the exercise of chivalry! “Luckless\n",
       "prince that I am!” said he, “to have been brought up in seclusion under\n",
       "the eye of a philosopher! Of what avail are algebra and philosophy in\n",
       "affairs of love? Alas, Eben Bonabben! why hast thou neglected to\n",
       "instruct me in the management of arms?” Upon this the owl broke silence,\n",
       "preluding his harangue with a pious ejaculation, for he was a devout\n",
       "Mussulman.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Allah Akbar! God is great!” exclaimed he; “in his hands are all secret\n",
       "things--he alone governs the destiny of princes! Know, O prince, that\n",
       "this land is full of mysteries, hidden from all but those who, like\n",
       "myself, can grope after knowledge in the dark. Know that in the\n",
       "neighboring mountains there is a cave, and in that cave there is an iron\n",
       "table, and on that table there lies a suit of magic armor, and beside\n",
       "that table there stands a spell-bound steed, which have been shut up\n",
       "there for many generations.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince stared with wonder, while the owl, blinking his huge round\n",
       "eyes, and erecting his horns, proceeded.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Many years since I accompanied my father to these parts on a tour of\n",
       "his estates, and we sojourned in that cave; and thus became I acquainted\n",
       "with the mystery. It is a tradition in our family which I have heard\n",
       "from my grandfather, when I was yet but a very little owlet, that this\n",
       "armor belonged to a Moorish magician, who took refuge in this cavern\n",
       "when Toledo was captured by the Christians, and died here, leaving his\n",
       "steed and weapons under a mystic spell, never to be used but by a\n",
       "Moslem, and by him only from sunrise to mid-day. In that interval,\n",
       "whoever uses them will overthrow every opponent.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Enough: let us seek this cave!” exclaimed Ahmed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Guided by his legendary mentor, the prince found the cavern, which was\n",
       "in one of the wildest recesses of those rocky cliffs which rise around\n",
       "Toledo; none but the mousing eye of an owl or an antiquary could have\n",
       "discovered the entrance to it. A sepulchral lamp of everlasting oil shed\n",
       "a solemn light through the place. On an iron table in the centre of the\n",
       "cavern lay the magic armor, against it leaned the lance, and beside it\n",
       "stood an Arabian steed, caparisoned for the field, but motionless as a\n",
       "statue. The armor was bright and unsullied as it had gleamed in days of\n",
       "old; the steed in as good condition as if just from the pasture; and\n",
       "when Ahmed laid his hand upon his neck, he pawed the ground and gave a\n",
       "loud neigh of joy that shook the walls of the cavern. Thus amply\n",
       "provided with “horse and rider and weapon to wear,” the prince\n",
       "determined to defy the field in the impending tourney.\n",
       "\n",
       "The eventful morning arrived. The lists for the combat were prepared in\n",
       "the Vega, or plain, just below the cliff-built walls of Toledo, where\n",
       "stages and galleries were erected for the spectators, covered with rich\n",
       "tapestry, and sheltered from the sun by silken awnings. All the beauties\n",
       "of the land were assembled in those galleries, while below pranced\n",
       "plumed knights with their pages and esquires, among whom figured\n",
       "conspicuously the princes who were to contend in the tourney. All the\n",
       "beauties of the land, however, were eclipsed when the Princess Aldegonda\n",
       "appeared in the royal pavilion, and for the first time broke forth upon\n",
       "the gaze of an admiring world. A murmur of wonder ran through the crowd\n",
       "at her transcendent loveliness; and the princes who were candidates for\n",
       "her hand, merely on the faith of her reported charms, now felt tenfold\n",
       "ardor for the conflict.\n",
       "\n",
       "The princess, however, had a troubled look. The color came and went from\n",
       "her cheek, and her eye wandered with a restless and unsatisfied\n",
       "expression over the plumed throng of knights. The trumpets were about\n",
       "sounding for the encounter, when the herald announced the arrival of a\n",
       "strange knight; and Ahmed rode into the field. A steel helmet studded\n",
       "with gems rose above his turban; his cuirass was embossed with gold; his\n",
       "cimeter and dagger were of the workmanship of Fez, and flamed with\n",
       "precious stones. A round shield was at his shoulder, and in his hand he\n",
       "bore the lance of charmed virtue. The caparison of his Arabian steed was\n",
       "richly embroidered and swept the ground, and the proud animal pranced\n",
       "and snuffed the air, and neighed with joy at once more beholding the\n",
       "array of arms. The lofty and graceful demeanor of the prince struck\n",
       "every eye, and when his appellation was announced, “The Pilgrim of\n",
       "Love,” a universal flutter and agitation prevailed among the fair dames\n",
       "in the galleries.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Ahmed presented himself at the lists, however, they were closed\n",
       "against him: none but princes, he was told, were admitted to the\n",
       "contest. He declared his name and rank. Still worse!--he was a Moslem,\n",
       "and could not engage in a tourney where the hand of a Christian princess\n",
       "was the prize.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rival princes surrounded him with haughty and menacing aspects; and\n",
       "one of insolent demeanor and herculean frame sneered at his light and\n",
       "youthful form, and scoffed at his amorous appellation. The ire of the\n",
       "prince was roused. He defied his rival to the encounter. They took\n",
       "distance, wheeled, and charged; and at the first touch of the magic\n",
       "lance, the brawny scoffer was tilted from his saddle. Here the prince\n",
       "would have paused, but, alas! he had to deal with a demoniac horse and\n",
       "armor; once in action, nothing could control them. The Arabian steed\n",
       "charged into the thickest of the throng; the lance overturned everything\n",
       "that presented; the gentle prince was carried pell-mell about the field,\n",
       "strewing it with high and low, gentle and simple, and grieving at his\n",
       "own involuntary exploits. The king stormed and raged at this outrage on\n",
       "his subjects and his guests. He ordered out all his guards--they were\n",
       "unhorsed as fast as they came up. The king threw off his robes, grasped\n",
       "buckler and lance, and rode forth to awe the stranger with the presence\n",
       "of majesty itself. Alas! majesty fared no better than the vulgar; the\n",
       "steed and lance were no respecters of persons; to the dismay of Ahmed,\n",
       "he was borne full tilt against the king, and in a moment the royal heels\n",
       "were in the air, and the crown was rolling in the dust.\n",
       "\n",
       "At this moment the sun reached the meridian; the magic spell resumed its\n",
       "power; the Arabian steed scoured across the plain, leaped the barrier,\n",
       "plunged into the Tagus, swam its raging current, bore the prince\n",
       "breathless and amazed to the cavern, and resumed his station, like a\n",
       "statue, beside the iron table. The prince dismounted right gladly, and\n",
       "replaced the armor, to abide the further decrees of fate. Then seating\n",
       "himself in the cavern, he ruminated on the desperate state to which this\n",
       "demoniac steed and armor had reduced him. Never should he dare to show\n",
       "his face at Toledo after inflicting such disgrace upon its chivalry and\n",
       "such an outrage on its king. What too would the princess think of so\n",
       "rude and riotous an achievement? Full of anxiety, he sent forth his\n",
       "winged messengers to gather tidings. The parrot resorted to all the\n",
       "public places and crowded resorts of the city, and soon returned with a\n",
       "world of gossip. All Toledo was in consternation. The princess had been\n",
       "borne off senseless to the palace; the tournament had ended in\n",
       "confusion; every one was talking of the sudden apparition, prodigious\n",
       "exploits, and strange disappearance of the Moslem knight. Some\n",
       "pronounced him a Moorish magician; others thought him a demon who had\n",
       "assumed a human shape, while others related traditions of enchanted\n",
       "warriors hidden in the caves of the mountains, and thought it might be\n",
       "one of these, who had made a sudden irruption from his den. All agreed\n",
       "that no mere ordinary mortal could have wrought such wonders, or\n",
       "unhorsed such accomplished and stalwart Christian warriors.\n",
       "\n",
       "The owl flew forth at night and hovered about the dusky city, perching\n",
       "on the roofs and chimneys. He then wheeled his flight up to the royal\n",
       "palace, which stood on a rocky summit of Toledo, and went prowling about\n",
       "its terraces and battlements, eavesdropping at every cranny, and glaring\n",
       "in with his big goggling eyes at every window where there was a light,\n",
       "so as to throw two or three maids of honor into fits. It was not until\n",
       "the gray dawn began to peer above the mountains that he returned from\n",
       "his mousing expedition, and related to the prince what he had seen.\n",
       "\n",
       "“As I was prying about one of the loftiest towers of the palace,” said\n",
       "he, “I beheld through a casement a beautiful princess. She was reclining\n",
       "on a couch with attendants and physicians around her, but she would none\n",
       "of their ministry and relief. When they retired, I beheld her draw forth\n",
       "a letter from her bosom, and read and kiss it, and give way to loud\n",
       "lamentations; at which, philosopher as I am, I could but be greatly\n",
       "moved.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The tender heart of Ahmed was distressed at these tidings. “Too true\n",
       "were thy words, O sage Eben Bonabben,” cried he; “care and sorrow and\n",
       "sleepless nights are the lot of lovers. Allah preserve the princess from\n",
       "the blighting influence of this thing called love!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Further intelligence from Toledo corroborated the report of the owl. The\n",
       "city was a prey to uneasiness and alarm. The princess was conveyed to\n",
       "the highest tower of the palace, every avenue to which was strongly\n",
       "guarded. In the mean time a devouring melancholy had seized upon her, of\n",
       "which no one could divine the cause--she refused food and turned a deaf\n",
       "ear to every consolation. The most skilful physicians had essayed their\n",
       "art in vain; it was thought some magic spell had been practised upon\n",
       "her, and the king made proclamation, declaring that whoever should\n",
       "effect her cure should receive the richest jewel in the royal treasury.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the owl, who was dozing in a corner, heard of this proclamation, he\n",
       "rolled his large eyes and looked more mysterious than ever.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Allah Akbar!” exclaimed he, “happy the man that shall effect that cure,\n",
       "should he but know what to choose from the royal treasury.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What mean you, most reverend owl?” said Ahmed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hearken, O prince, to what I shall relate. We owls, you must know, are\n",
       "a learned body, and much given to dark and dusty research. During my\n",
       "late prowling at night about the domes and turrets of Toledo, I\n",
       "discovered a college of antiquarian owls, who hold their meetings in a\n",
       "great vaulted tower where the royal treasury is deposited. Here they\n",
       "were discussing the forms and inscriptions and designs of ancient gems\n",
       "and jewels, and of golden and silver vessels, heaped up in the treasury,\n",
       "the fashion of every country and age; but mostly they were interested\n",
       "about certain relics and talismans that have remained in the treasury\n",
       "since the time of Roderick the Goth. Among these was a box of\n",
       "sandal-wood secured by bands of steel of Oriental workmanship, and\n",
       "inscribed with mystic characters known only to the learned few. This\n",
       "box and its inscription had occupied the college for several sessions,\n",
       "and had caused much long and grave dispute. At the time of my visit a\n",
       "very ancient owl, who had recently arrived from Egypt, was seated on the\n",
       "lid of the box, lecturing upon the inscription, and he proved from it\n",
       "that the coffer contained the silken carpet of the throne of Solomon the\n",
       "Wise; which doubtless had been brought to Toledo by the Jews who took\n",
       "refuge there after the downfall of Jerusalem.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When the owl had concluded his antiquarian harangue, the prince remained\n",
       "for a time absorbed in thought. “I have heard,” said he, “from the sage\n",
       "Eben Bonabben, of the wonderful properties of that talisman, which\n",
       "disappeared at the fall of Jerusalem, and was supposed to be lost to\n",
       "mankind. Doubtless it remains a sealed mystery to the Christians of\n",
       "Toledo. If I can get possession of that carpet, my fortune is secure.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The next day the prince laid aside his rich attire, and arrayed himself\n",
       "in the simple garb of an Arab of the desert. He dyed his complexion to a\n",
       "tawny hue, and no one could have recognized in him the splendid warrior\n",
       "who had caused such admiration and dismay at the tournament. With staff\n",
       "in hand, and scrip by his side, and a small pastoral reed, he repaired\n",
       "to Toledo, and presenting himself at the gate of the royal palace,\n",
       "announced himself as a candidate for the reward offered for the cure of\n",
       "the princess. The guards would have driven him away with blows. “What\n",
       "can a vagrant Arab like thyself pretend to do,” said they, “in a case\n",
       "where the most learned of the land have failed?” The king, however,\n",
       "overheard the tumult, and ordered the Arab to be brought into his\n",
       "presence.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Most potent king,” said Ahmed, “you behold before you a Bedouin Arab,\n",
       "the greater part of whose life has been passed in the solitudes of the\n",
       "desert. These solitudes, it is well known, are the haunts of demons and\n",
       "evil spirits, who beset us poor shepherds in our lonely watchings, enter\n",
       "into and possess our flocks and herds, and sometimes render even the\n",
       "patient camel furious; against these, our counter-charm is music; and we\n",
       "have legendary airs handed down from generation to generation, that we\n",
       "chant and pipe, to cast forth these evil spirits. I am of a gifted line,\n",
       "and possess this power in its fullest force. If it be any evil influence\n",
       "of the kind that holds a spell over thy daughter, I pledge my head to\n",
       "free her from its sway.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The king, who was a man of understanding, and knew the wonderful secrets\n",
       "possessed by the Arabs, was inspired with hope by the confident language\n",
       "of the prince. He conducted him immediately to the lofty tower, secured\n",
       "by several doors, in the summit of which was the chamber of the\n",
       "princess. The windows opened upon a terrace with balustrades, commanding\n",
       "a view over Toledo and all the surrounding country. The windows were\n",
       "darkened, for the princess lay within, a prey to a devouring grief that\n",
       "refused all alleviation.\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince seated himself on the terrace, and performed several wild\n",
       "Arabian airs on his pastoral pipe, which he had learnt from his\n",
       "attendants in the Generalife at Granada. The princess continued\n",
       "insensible, and the doctors who were present shook their heads, and\n",
       "smiled with incredulity and contempt: at length the prince laid aside\n",
       "the reed, and, to a simple melody, chanted the amatory verses of the\n",
       "letter which had declared his passion.\n",
       "\n",
       "The princess recognized the strain--a fluttering joy stole to her heart;\n",
       "she raised her head and listened; tears rushed to her eyes and streamed\n",
       "down her cheeks; her bosom rose and fell with a tumult of emotions. She\n",
       "would have asked for the minstrel to be brought into her presence, but\n",
       "maiden coyness held her silent. The king read her wishes, and at his\n",
       "command Ahmed was conducted into the chamber. The lovers were discreet:\n",
       "they but exchanged glances, yet those glances spoke volumes. Never was\n",
       "triumph of music more complete. The rose had returned to the soft cheek\n",
       "of the princess, the freshness to her lip, and the dewy light to her\n",
       "languishing eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "All the physicians present stared at each other with astonishment. The\n",
       "king regarded the Arab minstrel with admiration mixed with awe.\n",
       "“Wonderful youth!” exclaimed he, “thou shalt henceforth be the first\n",
       "physician of my court, and no other prescription will I take but thy\n",
       "melody. For the present receive thy reward, the most precious jewel in\n",
       "my treasury.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“O king,” replied Ahmed, “I care not for silver or gold or precious\n",
       "stones. One relic hast thou in thy treasury, handed down from the\n",
       "Moslems who once owned Toledo--a box of sandal-wood containing a silken\n",
       "carpet: give me that box, and I am content.”\n",
       "\n",
       "All present were surprised at the moderation of the Arab, and still more\n",
       "when the box of sandal-wood was brought and the carpet drawn forth. It\n",
       "was of fine green silk, covered with Hebrew and Chaldaic characters. The\n",
       "court physicians looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders, and\n",
       "smiled at the simplicity of this new practitioner, who could be content\n",
       "with so paltry a fee.\n",
       "\n",
       "“This carpet,” said the prince, “once covered the throne of Solomon the\n",
       "Wise; it is worthy of being placed beneath the feet of beauty.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So saying, he spread it on the terrace beneath an ottoman that had been\n",
       "brought forth for the princess; then seating himself at her feet--\n",
       "\n",

       "amidst wild and melancholy mountains, destitute of trees, and here and\n",
       "there tinted with scanty verdure. Everything within sight was severe and\n",
       "sterile, and it was scarcely possible to realize the idea that but a\n",
       "short distance behind us was the Generalife, with its blooming orchards\n",
       "and terraced gardens, and that we were in the vicinity of delicious\n",
       "Granada, that city of groves and fountains. But such is the nature of\n",

       "\n",
       "Our path continued up the barranco, with a bold, rugged height to our\n",
       "left, called the “Silla del Moro,” or Chair of the Moor, from the\n",
       "tradition already alluded to, that the unfortunate Boabdil fled thither\n",
       "during a popular insurrection, and remained all day seated on the rocky\n",
       "summit, looking mournfully down on his factious city.\n",
       "\n",
       "We at length arrived on the highest part of the promontory above\n",

       "the setting sun just gilded the loftiest heights. Here and there a\n",
       "solitary shepherd might be descried driving his flock down the\n",
       "declivities, to be folded for the night; or a muleteer and his lagging\n",
       "animals, threading some mountain path to arrive at the city gates before\n",

       "\n",
       "Presently the deep tones of the Cathedral bell came swelling up the\n",
       "defiles, proclaiming the hour of “oration” or prayer. The note was\n",
       "responded to from the belfry of every church, and from the sweet bells\n",
       "of the convents among the mountains. The shepherd paused on the fold of\n",
       "the hill, the muleteer in the midst of the road; each took off his hat\n",
       "and remained motionless for a time, murmuring his evening prayer. There\n",
       "is always something pleasingly solemn in this custom, by which, at a\n",
       "melodious signal, every human being throughout the land unites at the\n",
       "same moment in a tribute of thanks to God for the mercies of the day. It\n",
       "spreads a transient sanctity over the land, and the sight of the sun\n",
       "sinking in all his glory adds not a little to the solemnity of the\n",
       "scene.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the present instance the effect was heightened by the wild and lonely\n",
       "nature of the place. We were on the naked and broken summit of the\n",
       "haunted mountain of the sun, where ruined tanks and cisterns, and the\n",
       "mouldering foundations of extensive buildings, spoke of former\n",
       "populousness, but where all was now silent and desolate.\n",
       "\n",
       "As we were wandering about among these traces of old times, we came to a\n",
       "circular pit, penetrating deep into the bosom of the mountain; which\n",
       "Mateo pointed out as one of the wonders and mysteries of the place. I\n",
       "supposed it to be a well dug by the indefatigable Moors, to obtain their\n",
       "favorite element in its greatest purity. Mateo, however, had a different\n",
       "story, and one much more to his humor. According to a tradition, in\n",
       "which his father and grandfather firmly believed, this was an entrance\n",
       "to the subterranean caverns of the mountain, in which Boabdil and his\n",
       "court lay bound in magic spell, and whence they sallied forth at night,\n",
       "at allotted times, to revisit their ancient abodes.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ah, Señor, this mountain is full of wonders of the kind. In another\n",
       "place there was a hole somewhat like this, and just within it hung an\n",
       "iron pot by a chain; nobody knew what was in that pot, for it was always\n",
       "covered up; but everybody supposed it full of Moorish gold. Many tried\n",
       "to draw it forth, for it seemed just within reach; but the moment it was\n",
       "touched it would sink far, far down, and not come up again for some\n",
       "time. At last one who thought it must be enchanted touched it with the\n",
       "cross, by way of breaking the charm; and faith he did break it, for the\n",
       "pot sank out of sight and never was seen any more.\n",
       "\n",
       "“All this is fact, Señor; for my grandfather was an eye-witness.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What! Mateo; did he see the pot?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, Señor, but he saw the hole where the pot had hung.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It’s the same thing, Mateo.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The deepening twilight, which in this climate is of short duration,\n",
       "admonished us to leave this haunted ground. As we descended the mountain\n",
       "defile, there was no longer herdsman nor muleteer to be seen, nor\n",
       "anything to be heard but our own footsteps and the lonely chirping of\n",
       "the cricket. The shadows of the valley grew deeper and deeper, until all\n",
       "was dark around us. The lofty summit of the Sierra Nevada alone\n",
       "retained a lingering gleam of daylight; its snowy peaks glaring against\n",
       "the dark blue firmament, and seeming close to us, from the extreme\n",
       "purity of the atmosphere.\n",
       "\n",
       "“How near the Sierra looks this evening!” said Mateo; “it seems as if\n",
       "you could touch it with your hand; and yet it is many long leagues off.”\n",
       "While he was speaking, a star appeared over the snowy summit of the\n",
       "mountain, the only one yet visible in the heavens, and so pure, so\n",
       "large, so bright and beautiful, as to call forth ejaculations of delight\n",
       "from honest Mateo.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Que estrella hermosa! que clara y limpia es!--No pueda ser estrella mas\n",

       "brilliant!)\n",
       "\n",

       "the charms of natural objects. The lustre of a star, the beauty or\n",
       "fragrance of a flower, the crystal purity of a fountain, will inspire\n",
       "them with a kind of poetical delight; and then, what euphonious words\n",
       "their magnificent language affords, with which to give utterance to\n",
       "their transports!\n",
       "\n",
       "“But what lights are those, Mateo, which I see twinkling along the\n",
       "Sierra Nevada, just below the snowy region, and which might be taken for\n",
       "stars, only that they are ruddy, and against the dark side of the\n",
       "mountain?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Those, Señor, are fires, made by the men who gather snow and ice for\n",

       "and take turns, some to rest and warm themselves by the fires, while\n",
       "others fill the panniers with ice. They then set off down the mountains,\n",
       "so as to reach the gates of Granada before sunrise. That Sierra Nevada,\n",
       "Señor, is a lump of ice in the middle of Andalusia, to keep it all cool\n",
       "in summer.”\n",
       "\n",
       "It was now completely dark; we were passing through the barranco, where\n",
       "stood the cross of the murdered muleteer, when I beheld a number of\n",
       "lights moving at a distance, and apparently advancing up the ravine. On\n",
       "nearer approach they proved to be torches borne by a train of uncouth\n",
       "figures arrayed in black: it would have been a procession dreary enough\n",
       "at any time, but was peculiarly so in this wild and solitary place.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mateo drew near, and told me, in a low voice, that it was a funeral\n",
       "train bearing a corpse to the burying-ground among the hills.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the procession passed by, the lugubrious light of the torches,\n",
       "falling on the rugged features and funeral-weeds of the attendants, had\n",
       "the most fantastic effect, but was perfectly ghastly, as it revealed the\n",
       "countenance of the corpse, which, according to the Spanish custom, was\n",
       "borne uncovered on an open bier. I remained for some time gazing after\n",
       "the dreary train as it wound up the dark defile of the mountain. It put\n",
       "me in mind of the old story of a procession of demons bearing the body\n",
       "of a sinner up the crater of Stromboli.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ah! Señor,” cried Mateo, “I could tell you a story of a procession once\n",
       "seen among these mountains, but then you’d laugh at me, and say it was\n",
       "one of the legacies of my grandfather the tailor.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“By no means, Mateo. There is nothing I relish more than a marvellous\n",
       "tale.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, Señor, it is about one of those very men we have been talking of,\n",
       "who gather snow on the Sierra Nevada.\n",
       "\n",
       "“You must know, that a great many years since, in my grandfather’s time,\n",
       "there was an old fellow, Tio Nicolo [Uncle Nicholas] by name, who had\n",
       "filled the panniers of his mule with snow and ice, and was returning\n",
       "down the mountain. Being very drowsy, he mounted upon the mule, and soon\n",
       "falling asleep, went with his head nodding and bobbing about from side\n",
       "to side, while his sure-footed old mule stepped along the edge of\n",
       "precipices, and down steep and broken barrancos, just as safe and steady\n",
       "as if it had been on plain ground. At length Tio Nicolo awoke, and gazed\n",
       "about him, and rubbed his eyes--and, in good truth, he had reason. The\n",
       "moon shone almost as bright as day, and he saw the city below him, as\n",
       "plain as your hand, and shining with its white buildings, like a silver\n",
       "platter, in the moonshine; but, Lord! Señor, it was nothing like the\n",
       "city he had left a few hours before! Instead of the cathedral, with its\n",
       "great dome and turrets, and the churches with their spires, and the\n",
       "convents with their pinnacles, all surmounted with the blessed cross, he\n",
       "saw nothing but Moorish mosques, and minarets, and cupolas, all topped\n",
       "off with glittering crescents, such as you see on the Barbary flags.\n",
       "Well, Señor, as you may suppose, Tio Nicolo was mightily puzzled at all\n",
       "this, but while he was gazing down upon the city, a great army came\n",
       "marching up the mountains, winding along the ravines, sometimes in the\n",
       "moonshine, sometimes in the shade. As it drew nigh, he saw that there\n",
       "were horse and foot, all in Moorish armor. Tio Nicolo tried to scramble\n",
       "out of their way, but his old mule stood stockstill, and refused to\n",
       "budge, trembling, at the same time, like a leaf,--for dumb beasts,\n",
       "Señor, are just as much frightened at such things as human beings. Well,\n",
       "Señor, the hobgoblin army came marching by; there were men that seemed\n",
       "to blow trumpets, and others to beat drums and strike cymbals, yet never\n",
       "a sound did they make; they all moved on without the least noise, just\n",
       "as I have seen painted armies move across the stage in the theatre of\n",
       "Granada, and all looked as pale as death. At last, in the rear of the\n",
       "army, between two black Moorish horsemen, rode the Grand Inquisitor of\n",
       "Granada, on a mule as white as snow. Tio Nicolo wondered to see him in\n",
       "such company, for the Inquisitor was famous for his hatred of Moors,\n",
       "and, indeed, of all kinds of Infidels, Jews, and heretics, and used to\n",
       "hunt them out with fire and scourge. However, Tio Nicolo felt himself\n",
       "safe, now that there was a priest of such sanctity at hand. So making\n",
       "the sign of the cross, he called out for his benediction, when, hombre!\n",
       "he received a blow that sent him and his old mule over the edge of a\n",
       "steep bank, down which they rolled, head-over-heels, to the bottom! Tio\n",
       "Nicolo did not come to his senses until long after sunrise, when he\n",
       "found himself at the bottom of a deep ravine, his mule grazing beside\n",
       "him, and his panniers of snow completely melted. He crawled back to\n",
       "Granada sorely bruised and battered, but was glad to find the city\n",
       "looking as usual, with Christian churches and crosses. When he told the\n",
       "story of his night’s adventure, every one laughed at him; some said he\n",
       "had dreamed it all, as he dozed on his mule; others thought it all a\n",
       "fabrication of his own; but what was strange, Señor, and made people\n",
       "afterwards think more seriously of the matter, was, that the Grand\n",
       "Inquisitor died within the year. I have often heard my grandfather, the\n",
       "tailor, say, that there was more meant by that hobgoblin army bearing\n",
       "off the resemblance of the priest, than folks dared to surmise.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then you would insinuate, friend Mateo, that there is a kind of Moorish\n",

       "of water, hidden from sight, and which have existed from the time of the\n",
       "Moors. At one corner of this esplanade is a Moorish well, cut through\n",
       "the living rock to a great depth, the water of which is cold as ice and\n",
       "clear as crystal. The wells made by the Moors are always in repute, for\n",
       "it is well known what pains they took to penetrate to the purest and\n",
       "sweetest springs and fountains. The one of which we now speak is famous\n",
       "throughout Granada, insomuch that water-carriers, some bearing great\n",
       "water-jars on their shoulders, others driving asses before them laden\n",
       "with earthen vessels, are ascending and descending the steep woody\n",
       "avenues of the Alhambra, from early dawn until a late hour of the\n",
       "night.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fountains and wells, ever since the scriptural days, have been noted\n",
       "gossiping-places in hot climates; and at the well in question there is a\n",
       "kind of perpetual club kept up during the livelong day, by the invalids,\n",
       "old women, and other curious do-nothing folk of the fortress, who sit\n",
       "here on the stone benches, under an awning spread over the well to\n",
       "shelter the toll-gatherer from the sun, and dawdle over the gossip of\n",
       "the fortress, and question every water-carrier that arrives about the\n",
       "news of the city, and make long comments on everything they hear and\n",
       "see. Not an hour of the day but loitering housewives and idle\n",
       "maid-servants may be seen, lingering, with pitcher on head or in hand,\n",
       "to hear the last of the endless tattle of these worthies.\n",
       "\n",
       "Among the water-carriers who once resorted to this well, there was a\n",
       "sturdy, strong-backed, bandy-legged little fellow, named Pedro Gil, but\n",
       "called Peregil for shortness. Being a water-carrier, he was a Gallego,\n",
       "or native of Gallicia, of course. Nature seems to have formed races of\n",
       "men, as she has of animals, for different kinds of drudgery. In France\n",
       "the shoeblacks are all Savoyards, the porters of hotels all Swiss, and\n",
       "in the days of hoops and hair-powder in England, no man could give the\n",
       "regular swing to a sedan-chair but a bog-trotting Irishman. So in Spain,\n",
       "the carriers of water and bearers of burdens are all sturdy little\n",
       "natives of Gallicia. No man says, “Get me a porter,” but, “Call a\n",
       "Gallego.”\n",
       "\n",
       "To return from this digression, Peregil the Gallego had begun business\n",
       "with merely a great earthen jar which he carried upon his shoulder; by\n",
       "degrees he rose in the world, and was enabled to purchase an assistant\n",
       "of a correspondent class of animals, being a stout shaggy-haired donkey.\n",
       "On each side of this his long-eared aide-de-camp, in a kind of pannier,\n",
       "were slung his water-jars, covered with fig-leaves to protect them from\n",
       "the sun. There was not a more industrious water-carrier in all Granada,\n",
       "nor one more merry withal. The streets rang with his cheerful voice as\n",
       "he trudged after his donkey, singing forth the usual summer note that\n",
       "resounds through the Spanish towns: “_Quien quiere agua--agua mas fria\n",
       "que la nieve?_”--“Who wants water--water colder than snow? Who wants\n",
       "water from the well of the Alhambra, cold as ice and clear as crystal?”\n",
       "When he served a customer with a sparkling glass, it was always with a\n",
       "pleasant word that caused a smile; and if, perchance, it was a comely\n",
       "dame or dimpling damsel, it was always with a sly leer and a compliment\n",
       "to her beauty that was irresistible. Thus Peregil the Gallego was noted\n",
       "throughout all Granada for being one of the civilest, pleasantest, and\n",
       "happiest of mortals. Yet it is not he who sings loudest and jokes most\n",
       "that has the lightest heart. Under all this air of merriment, honest\n",
       "Peregil had his cares and troubles. He had a large family of ragged\n",
       "children to support, who were hungry and clamorous as a nest of young\n",
       "swallows, and beset him with their outcries for food whenever he came\n",
       "home of an evening. He had a helpmate, too, who was anything but a help\n",
       "to him. She had been a village beauty before marriage, noted for her\n",
       "skill at dancing the bolero and rattling the castanets; and she still\n",
       "retained her early propensities, spending the hard earnings of honest\n",
       "Peregil in frippery, and laying the very donkey under requisition for\n",
       "junketing parties into the country on Sundays, and saints’ days, and\n",
       "those innumerable holidays which are rather more numerous in Spain than\n",
       "the days of the week. With all this she was a little of a slattern,\n",
       "something more of a lie-abed, and, above all, a gossip of the first\n",
       "water; neglecting house, household, and everything else, to loiter\n",
       "slipshod in the houses of her gossip neighbors.\n",
       "\n",
       "He, however, who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb, accommodates the\n",
       "yoke of matrimony to the submissive neck. Peregil bore all the heavy\n",
       "dispensations of wife and children with as meek a spirit as his donkey\n",
       "bore the water-jars; and, however he might shake his ears in private,\n",
       "never ventured to question the household virtues of his slattern spouse.\n",
       "\n",
       "He loved his children, too, even as an owl loves its owlets, seeing in\n",
       "them his own image multiplied and perpetuated; for they were a sturdy,\n",
       "long-backed, bandy-legged little brood. The great pleasure of honest\n",
       "Peregil was, whenever he could afford himself a scanty holiday, and had\n",
       "a handful of maravedis to spare, to take the whole litter forth with\n",
       "him, some in his arms, some tugging at his skirts, and some trudging at\n",
       "his heels, and to treat them to a gambol among the orchards of the Vega,\n",
       "while his wife was dancing with her holiday friends in the Angosturas of\n",
       "the Darro.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a late hour one summer night, and most of the water-carriers had\n",
       "desisted from their toils. The day had been uncommonly sultry; the night\n",
       "was one of those delicious moonlights which tempt the inhabitants of\n",
       "southern climes to indemnify themselves for the heat and inaction of the\n",
       "day, by lingering in the open air, and enjoying its tempered sweetness\n",
       "until after midnight. Customers for water were therefore still abroad.\n",
       "Peregil, like a considerate, painstaking father, thought of his hungry\n",
       "children. “One more journey to the well,” said he to himself, “to earn a\n",
       "Sunday’s puchero for the little ones.” So saying, he trudged manfully up\n",
       "the steep avenue of the Alhambra, singing as he went, and now and then\n",
       "bestowing a hearty thwack with a cudgel on the flanks of his donkey,\n",
       "either by way of cadence to the song, or refreshment to the animal; for\n",
       "dry blows serve in lieu of provender in Spain for all beasts of burden.\n",
       "\n",
       "When arrived at the well, he found it deserted by every one except a\n",
       "solitary stranger in Moorish garb, seated on a stone bench in the\n",
       "moonlight. Peregil paused at first and regarded him with surprise, not\n",
       "unmixed with awe, but the Moor feebly beckoned him to approach. “I am\n",
       "faint and ill,” said he; “aid me to return to the city, and I will pay\n",
       "thee double what thou couldst gain by thy jars of water.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The honest heart of the little water-carrier was touched with compassion\n",
       "at the appeal of the stranger. “God forbid,” said he, “that I should ask\n",
       "fee or reward for doing a common act of humanity.” He accordingly helped\n",
       "the Moor on his donkey, and set off slowly for Granada, the poor Moslem\n",
       "being so weak that it was necessary to hold him on the animal to keep\n",
       "him from falling to the earth.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they entered the city, the water-carrier demanded whither he should\n",
       "conduct him. “Alas!” said the Moor, faintly, “I have neither home nor\n",
       "habitation; I am a stranger in the land. Suffer me to lay my head this\n",
       "night beneath thy roof, and thou shalt be amply repaid.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Honest Peregil thus saw himself unexpectedly saddled with an infidel\n",
       "guest, but he was too humane to refuse a night’s shelter to a\n",
       "fellow-being in so forlorn a plight; so he conducted the Moor to his\n",
       "dwelling. The children, who had sallied forth open-mouthed as usual on\n",
       "hearing the tramp of the donkey, ran back with affright when they beheld\n",
       "the turbaned stranger, and hid themselves behind their mother. The\n",
       "latter stepped forth intrepidly, like a ruffling hen before her brood\n",
       "when a vagrant dog approaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What infidel companion,” cried she, “is this you have brought home at\n",
       "this late hour, to draw upon us the eyes of the inquisition?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Be quiet, wife,” replied the Gallego; “here is a poor sick stranger,\n",
       "without friend or home; wouldst thou turn him forth to perish in the\n",
       "streets?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The wife would still have remonstrated, for although she lived in a\n",
       "hovel, she was a furious stickler for the credit of her house; the\n",
       "little water-carrier, however, for once was stiffnecked, and refused to\n",
       "bend beneath the yoke. He assisted the poor Moslem to alight, and spread\n",
       "a mat and a sheep-skin for him, on the ground, in the coolest part of\n",
       "the house; being the only kind of bed that his poverty afforded.\n",
       "\n",
       "In a little while the Moor was seized with violent convulsions, which\n",
       "defied all the ministering skill of the simple water-carrier. The eye of\n",
       "the poor patient acknowledged his kindness. During an interval of his\n",
       "fits he called him to his side, and addressing him in a low voice, “My\n",
       "end,” said he, “I fear is at hand. If I die, I bequeath you this box as\n",
       "a reward for your charity”: so saying, he opened his albornoz, or cloak,\n",
       "and showed a small box of sandal-wood, strapped round his body. “God\n",
       "grant, my friend,” replied the worthy little Gallego, “that you may live\n",
       "many years to enjoy your treasure, whatever it may be.” The Moor shook\n",
       "his head; he laid his hand upon the box, and would have said something\n",
       "more concerning it, but his convulsions returned with increasing\n",
       "violence, and in a little while he expired.\n",
       "\n",
       "The water-carrier’s wife was now as one distracted. “This comes,” said\n",
       "she, “of your foolish good-nature, always running into scrapes to oblige\n",
       "others. What will become of us when this corpse is found in our house?\n",
       "We shall be sent to prison as murderers; and if we escape with our\n",
       "lives, shall be ruined by notaries and alguazils.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Poor Peregil was in equal tribulation, and almost repented himself of\n",
       "having done a good deed. At length a thought struck him. “It is not yet\n",
       "day,” said he; “I can convey the dead body out of the city, and bury it\n",
       "in the sands on the banks of the Xenil. No one saw the Moor enter our\n",
       "dwelling, and no one will know anything of his death.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So said, so done. The wife aided him; they rolled the body of the\n",
       "unfortunate Moslem in the mat on which he had expired, laid it across\n",
       "the ass, and Peregil set out with it for the banks of the river.\n",
       "\n",
       "As ill luck would have it, there lived opposite to the water-carrier a\n",
       "barber named Pedrillo Pedrugo, one of the most prying, tattling, and\n",
       "mischief-making of his gossip tribe. He was a weasel-faced,\n",
       "spider-legged varlet, supple and insinuating; the famous barber of\n",
       "Seville could not surpass him for his universal knowledge of the affairs\n",
       "of others, and he had no more power of retention than a sieve. It was\n",
       "said that he slept but with one eye at a time, and kept one ear\n",
       "uncovered, so that even in his sleep he might see and hear all that was\n",
       "going on. Certain it is, he was a sort of scandalous chronicle for the\n",
       "quidnuncs of Granada, and had more customers than all the rest of his\n",
       "fraternity.\n",
       "\n",
       "This meddlesome barber heard Peregil arrive at an unusual hour at night,\n",
       "and the exclamations of his wife and children. His head was instantly\n",
       "popped out of a little window which served him as a look-out, and he saw\n",
       "his neighbor assist a man in Moorish garb into his dwelling. This was so\n",
       "strange an occurrence, that Pedrillo Pedrugo slept not a wink that\n",
       "night. Every five minutes he was at his loophole, watching the lights\n",
       "that gleamed through the chinks of his neighbor’s door, and before\n",
       "daylight he beheld Peregil sally forth with his donkey unusually laden.\n",
       "\n",
       "The inquisitive barber was in a fidget; he slipped on his clothes, and,\n",
       "stealing forth silently, followed the water-carrier at a distance, until\n",
       "he saw him dig a hole in the sandy bank of the Xenil, and bury something\n",
       "that had the appearance of a dead body.\n",
       "\n",
       "The barber hied him home, and fidgeted about his shop, setting\n",
       "everything upside down, until sunrise. He then took a basin under his\n",
       "arm, and sallied forth to the house of his daily customer the alcalde.\n",
       "\n",
       "The alcalde was just risen. Pedrillo Pedrugo seated him in a chair,\n",
       "threw a napkin round his neck, put a basin of hot water under his chin,\n",
       "and began to mollify his beard with his fingers.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Strange doings!” said Pedrugo, who played barber and newsmonger at the\n",
       "same time,--“strange doings! Robbery, and murder, and burial all in one\n",
       "night!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hey!--how!--what is that you say?” cried the alcalde.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I say,” replied the barber, rubbing a piece of soap over the nose and\n",
       "mouth of the dignitary, for a Spanish barber disdains to employ a\n",
       "brush,--“I say that Peregil the Gallego has robbed and murdered a\n",
       "Moorish Mussulman, and buried him, this blessed night. _Maldita sea la\n",
       "noche_;--Accursed be the night for the same!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But how do you know all this?” demanded the alcalde.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Be patient, Señor, and you shall hear all about it,” replied Pedrillo,\n",
       "taking him by the nose and sliding a razor over his cheek. He then\n",
       "recounted all that he had seen, going through both operations at the\n",
       "same time, shaving his beard, washing his chin, and wiping him dry with\n",
       "a dirty napkin, while he was robbing, murdering, and burying the Moslem.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now it so happened that this alcalde was one of the most overbearing,\n",
       "and at the same time most griping and corrupt curmudgeons in all\n",
       "Granada. It could not be denied, however, that he set a high value upon\n",
       "justice, for he sold it at its weight in gold. He presumed the case in\n",
       "point to be one of murder and robbery; doubtless there must be a rich\n",
       "spoil; how was it to be secured into the legitimate hands of the law?\n",
       "for as to merely entrapping the delinquent--that would be feeding the\n",
       "gallows; but entrapping the booty--that would be enriching the judge,\n",
       "and such, according to his creed, was the great end of justice. So\n",
       "thinking, he summoned to his presence his trustiest alguazil--a gaunt,\n",
       "hungry-looking varlet, clad, according to the custom of his order, in\n",
       "the ancient Spanish garb, a broad black beaver turned up at its sides; a\n",
       "quaint ruff; a small black cloak dangling from his shoulders; rusty\n",
       "black under-clothes that set off his spare wiry frame, while in his hand\n",
       "he bore a slender white wand, the dreaded insignia of his office. Such\n",
       "was the legal bloodhound of the ancient Spanish breed, that he put upon\n",
       "the traces of the unlucky water-carrier, and such was his speed and\n",
       "certainty, that he was upon the haunches of poor Peregil before he had\n",
       "returned to his dwelling, and brought both him and his donkey before the\n",
       "dispenser of justice.\n",
       "\n",
       "The alcalde bent upon him one of the most terrific frowns. “Hark ye,\n",
       "culprit!” roared he, in a voice that made the knees of the little\n",
       "Gallego smite together,--“hark ye, culprit! there is no need of denying\n",
       "thy guilt, everything is known to me. A gallows is the proper reward for\n",
       "the crime thou hast committed, but I am merciful, and readily listen to\n",
       "reason. The man that has been murdered in thy house was a Moor, an\n",
       "infidel, the enemy of our faith. It was doubtless in a fit of religious\n",
       "zeal that thou hast slain him. I will be indulgent, therefore; render up\n",
       "the property of which thou hast robbed him, and we will hush the matter\n",
       "up.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The poor water-carrier called upon all the saints to witness his\n",
       "innocence; alas! not one of them appeared; and if they had, the alcalde\n",
       "would have disbelieved the whole calendar. The water-carrier related the\n",
       "whole story of the dying Moor with the straightforward simplicity of\n",
       "truth, but it was all in vain. “Wilt thou persist in saying,” demanded\n",
       "the judge, “that this Moslem had neither gold nor jewels, which were the\n",
       "object of thy cupidity?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“As I hope to be saved, your worship,” replied the water-carrier, “he\n",
       "had nothing but a small box of sandal-wood which he bequeathed to me in\n",
       "reward for my services.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A box of sandal-wood! a box of sandal-wood!” exclaimed the alcalde, his\n",
       "eyes sparkling at the idea of precious jewels. “And where is this box?\n",
       "where have you concealed it?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“An’ it please your grace,” replied the water-carrier, “it is in one of\n",
       "the panniers of my mule, and heartily at the service of your worship.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He had hardly spoken the words, when the keen alguazil darted off, and\n",
       "reappeared in an instant with the mysterious box of sandal-wood. The\n",
       "alcalde opened it with an eager and trembling hand; all pressed forward\n",
       "to gaze upon the treasure it was expected to contain; when, to their\n",
       "disappointment, nothing appeared within, but a parchment scroll, covered\n",
       "with Arabic characters, and an end of a waxen taper.\n",
       "\n",
       "When there is nothing to be gained by the conviction of a prisoner,\n",
       "justice, even in Spain, is apt to be impartial. The alcalde, having\n",
       "recovered from his disappointment, and found that there was really no\n",
       "booty in the case, now listened dispassionately to the explanation of\n",
       "the water-carrier, which was corroborated by the testimony of his wife.\n",
       "Being convinced, therefore, of his innocence, he discharged him from\n",
       "arrest; nay, more, he permitted him to carry off the Moor’s legacy, the\n",
       "box of sandal-wood and its contents, as the well-merited reward of his\n",
       "humanity; but he retained his donkey in payment of costs and charges.\n",
       "\n",
       "Behold the unfortunate little Gallego reduced once more to the necessity\n",
       "of being his own water-carrier, and trudging up to the well of the\n",
       "Alhambra with a great earthen jar upon his shoulder.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he toiled up the hill in the heat of a summer noon, his usual\n",
       "good-humor forsook him. “Dog of an alcalde!” would he cry, “to rob a\n",
       "poor man of the means of his subsistence, of the best friend he had in\n",
       "the world!” And then at the remembrance of the beloved companion of his\n",
       "labors, all the kindness of his nature would break forth. “Ah, donkey of\n",
       "my heart!” would he exclaim, resting his burden on a stone, and wiping\n",
       "the sweat from his brow,--“ah, donkey of my heart! I warrant me thou\n",

       "laughing in mockery at his vexation. Seizing it up, he dashed it with\n",
       "indignation to the floor. “Unlucky was the day that I ever set eyes on\n",
       "thee,” he cried, “or sheltered thy master beneath my roof!”\n",
       "\n",
       "As the box struck the floor, the lid flew wide open, and the parchment\n",
       "scroll rolled forth.\n",
       "\n",
       "Peregil sat regarding the scroll for some time in moody silence. At\n",
       "length rallying his ideas, “Who knows,” thought he, “but this writing\n",
       "may be of some importance, as the Moor seems to have guarded it with\n",
       "such care?” Picking it up therefore, he put it in his bosom, and the\n",
       "next morning, as he was crying water through the streets, he stopped at\n",
       "the shop of a Moor, a native of Tangiers, who sold trinkets and\n",
       "perfumery in the Zacatin, and asked him to explain the contents.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Moor read the scroll attentively, then stroked his beard and smiled.\n",
       "“This manuscript,” said he, “is a form of incantation for the recovery\n",
       "of hidden treasure that is under the power of enchantment. It is said to\n",
       "have such virtue that the strongest bolts and bars, nay the adamantine\n",
       "rock itself, will yield before it!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Bah!” cried the little Gallego, “what is all that to me? I am no\n",
       "enchanter, and know nothing of buried treasure.” So saying, he\n",
       "shouldered his water-jar, left the scroll in the hands of the Moor, and\n",
       "trudged forward on his daily rounds.\n",
       "\n",
       "That evening, however, as he rested himself about twilight at the well\n",
       "of the Alhambra, he found a number of gossips assembled at the place,\n",
       "and their conversation, as is not unusual at that shadowy hour, turned\n",
       "upon old tales and traditions of a supernatural nature. Being all poor\n",
       "as rats, they dwelt with peculiar fondness upon the popular theme of\n",
       "enchanted riches left by the Moors in various parts of the Alhambra.\n",
       "Above all, they concurred in the belief that there were great treasures\n",
       "buried deep in the earth under the tower of the seven floors.\n",
       "\n",
       "These stories made an unusual impression on the mind of the honest\n",
       "Peregil, and they sank deeper and deeper into his thoughts as he\n",
       "returned alone down the darkling avenues. “If, after all, there should\n",
       "be treasure hid beneath that tower; and if the scroll I left with the\n",
       "Moor should enable me to get at it!” In the sudden ecstasy of the\n",
       "thought he had wellnigh let fall his water-jar.\n",
       "\n",
       "That night he tumbled and tossed, and could scarcely get a wink of sleep\n",
       "for the thoughts that were bewildering his brain. Bright and early he\n",
       "repaired to the shop of the Moor, and told him all that was passing in\n",
       "his mind. “You can read Arabic,” said he; “suppose we go together to the\n",
       "tower, and try the effect of the charm; if it fails, we are no worse off\n",
       "than before; but if it succeeds, we will share equally all the treasure\n",
       "we may discover.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hold,” replied the Moslem; “this writing is not sufficient of itself;\n",
       "it must be read at midnight, by the light of a taper singularly\n",
       "compounded and prepared, the ingredients of which are not within my\n",
       "reach. Without such a taper the scroll is of no avail.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Say no more!” cried the little Gallego; “I have such a taper at hand,\n",
       "and will bring it here in a moment.” So saying, he hastened home, and\n",
       "soon returned with the end of yellow wax taper that he had found in the\n",
       "box of sandal-wood.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Moor felt it and smelt to it. “Here are rare and costly perfumes,”\n",
       "said he, “combined with this yellow wax. This is the kind of taper\n",
       "specified in the scroll. While this burns, the strongest walls and most\n",
       "secret caverns will remain open. Woe to him, however, who lingers within\n",
       "until it be extinguished. He will remain enchanted with the treasure.”\n",
       "\n",
       "It was now agreed between them to try the charm that very night. At a\n",
       "late hour, therefore, when nothing was stirring but bats and owls, they\n",
       "ascended the woody hill of the Alhambra, and approached that awful\n",
       "tower, shrouded by trees and rendered formidable by so many traditionary\n",
       "tales. By the light of a lantern they groped their way through bushes,\n",
       "and over fallen stones, to the door of a vault beneath the tower. With\n",
       "fear and trembling they descended a flight of steps cut into the rock.\n",
       "It led to an empty chamber, damp and drear, from which another flight of\n",
       "steps led to a deeper vault. In this way they descended four several\n",
       "flights, leading into as many vaults, one below the other, but the floor\n",
       "of the fourth was solid; and though, according to tradition, there\n",
       "remained three vaults still below, it was said to be impossible to\n",
       "penetrate further, the residue being shut up by strong enchantment. The\n",
       "air of this vault was damp and chilly, and had an earthy smell, and the\n",
       "light scarce cast forth any rays. They paused here for a time, in\n",
       "breathless suspense, until they faintly heard the clock of the\n",
       "watch-tower strike midnight; upon this they lit the waxen taper, which\n",
       "diffused an odor of myrrh and frankincense and storax.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Moor began to read in a hurried voice. He had scarce finished when\n",
       "there was a noise as of subterraneous thunder. The earth shook, and the\n",
       "floor, yawning open, disclosed a flight of steps. Trembling with awe,\n",
       "they descended, and by the light of the lantern found themselves in\n",
       "another vault covered with Arabic inscriptions. In the centre stood a\n",
       "great chest, secured with seven bands of steel, at each end of which sat\n",
       "an enchanted Moor in armor, but motionless as a statue, being controlled\n",
       "by the power of the incantation. Before the chest were several jars\n",
       "filled with gold and silver and precious stones. In the largest of these\n",
       "they thrust their arms up to the elbow, and at every dip hauled forth\n",
       "handfuls of broad yellow pieces of Moorish gold, or bracelets and\n",
       "ornaments of the same precious metal, while occasionally a necklace of\n",
       "Oriental pearl would stick to their fingers. Still they trembled and\n",
       "breathed short while cramming their pockets with the spoils; and cast\n",
       "many a fearful glance at the two enchanted Moors, who sat grim and\n",
       "motionless, glaring upon them with unwinking eyes. At length, struck\n",
       "with a sudden panic at some fancied noise, they both rushed up the\n",
       "staircase, tumbled over one another into the upper apartment, overturned\n",
       "and extinguished the waxen taper, and the pavement again closed with a\n",
       "thundering sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "Filled with dismay, they did not pause until they had groped their way\n",
       "out of the tower, and beheld the stars shining through the trees. Then\n",
       "seating themselves upon the grass, they divided the spoil, determining\n",
       "to content themselves for the present with this mere skimming of the\n",
       "jars, but to return on some future night and drain them to the bottom.\n",
       "To make sure of each other’s good faith, also, they divided the\n",
       "talismans between them, one retaining the scroll and the other the\n",
       "taper; this done, they set off with light hearts and well-lined pockets\n",
       "for Granada.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they wended their way down the hill, the shrewd Moor whispered a word\n",
       "of counsel in the ear of the simple little water-carrier.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Friend Peregil,” said he, “all this affair must be kept a profound\n",
       "secret until we have secured the treasure, and conveyed it out of harm’s\n",
       "way. If a whisper of it gets to the ear of the alcalde, we are undone!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Certainly,” replied the Gallego, “nothing can be more true.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Friend Peregil,” said the Moor, “you are a discreet man, and I make no\n",
       "doubt can keep a secret; but you have a wife.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“She shall not know a word of it,” replied the little water-carrier\n",
       "sturdily.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Enough,” said the Moor, “I depend upon thy discretion and thy promise.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Never was promise more positive and sincere; but, alas! what man can\n",
       "keep a secret from his wife? Certainly not such a one as Peregil the\n",
       "water-carrier, who was one of the most loving and tractable of husbands.\n",
       "On his return home, he found his wife moping in a corner. “Mighty well,”\n",
       "cried she as he entered, “you’ve come at last, after rambling about\n",
       "until this hour of the night. I wonder you have not brought home\n",
       "another Moor as a house-mate.” Then bursting into tears, she began to\n",
       "wring her hands and smite her breast. “Unhappy woman that I am!”\n",
       "exclaimed she, “what will become of me? My house stripped and plundered\n",
       "by lawyers and alguazils; my husband a do-no-good, that no longer brings\n",
       "home bread to his family, but goes rambling about day and night, with\n",
       "infidel Moors! O my children! my children! what will become of us? We\n",
       "shall all have to beg in the streets!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Honest Peregil was so moved by the distress of his spouse, that he could\n",
       "not help whimpering also. His heart was as full as his pocket, and not\n",
       "to be restrained. Thrusting his hand into the latter he hauled forth\n",
       "three or four broad gold pieces, and slipped them into her bosom. The\n",
       "poor woman stared with astonishment, and could not understand the\n",
       "meaning of this golden shower. Before she could recover her surprise,\n",
       "the little Gallego drew forth a chain of gold and dangled it before her,\n",
       "capering with exultation, his mouth distended from ear to ear.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Holy Virgin protect us!” exclaimed the wife. “What hast thou been\n",
       "doing, Peregil? surely thou hast not been committing murder and\n",
       "robbery!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The idea scarce entered the brain of the poor woman, than it became a\n",
       "certainty with her. She saw a prison and a gallows in the distance, and\n",
       "a little bandy-legged Gallego hanging pendent from it; and, overcome by\n",
       "the horrors conjured up by her imagination, fell into violent hysterics.\n",
       "\n",
       "What could the poor man do? He had no other means of pacifying his wife,\n",
       "and dispelling the phantoms of her fancy, than by relating the whole\n",
       "story of his good fortune. This, however, he did not do until he had\n",
       "exacted from her the most solemn promise to keep it a profound secret\n",
       "from every living being.\n",
       "\n",
       "To describe her joy would be impossible. She flung her arms round the\n",
       "neck of her husband, and almost strangled him with her caresses. “Now,\n",
       "wife,” exclaimed the little man with honest exultation, “what say you\n",
       "now to the Moor’s legacy? Henceforth never abuse me for helping a\n",
       "fellow-creature in distress.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The honest Gallego retired to his sheep-skin mat, and slept as soundly\n",
       "as if on a bed of down. Not so his wife; she emptied the whole contents\n",
       "of his pockets upon the mat, and sat counting gold pieces of Arabic\n",
       "coin, trying on necklaces and earrings, and fancying the figure she\n",
       "should one day make when permitted to enjoy her riches.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the following morning the honest Gallego took a broad golden coin,\n",
       "and repaired with it to a jeweller’s shop in the Zacatin to offer it for\n",
       "sale, pretending to have found it among the ruins of the Alhambra. The\n",
       "jeweller saw that it had an Arabic inscription, and was of the purest\n",
       "gold; he offered, however, but a third of its value, with which the\n",
       "water-carrier was perfectly content. Peregil now bought new clothes for\n",
       "his little flock, and all kinds of toys, together with ample provisions\n",
       "for a hearty meal, and returning to his dwelling, set all his children\n",
       "dancing around him, while he capered in the midst, the happiest of\n",
       "fathers.\n",
       "\n",
       "The wife of the water-carrier kept her promise of secrecy with\n",
       "surprising strictness. For a whole day and a half she went about with a\n",
       "look of mystery and a heart swelling almost to bursting, yet she held\n",
       "her peace, though surrounded by her gossips. It is true, she could not\n",
       "help giving herself a few airs, apologized for her ragged dress, and\n",
       "talked of ordering a new basquiña all trimmed with gold lace and bugles,\n",
       "and a new lace mantilla. She threw out hints of her husband’s intention\n",
       "of leaving off his trade of water-carrying, as it did not altogether\n",
       "agree with his health. In fact she thought they should all retire to the\n",
       "country for the summer, that the children might have the benefit of the\n",
       "mountain air, for there was no living in the city in this sultry season.\n",
       "\n",
       "The neighbors stared at each other, and thought the poor woman had lost\n",
       "her wits; and her airs and graces and elegant pretensions were the theme\n",
       "of universal scoffing and merriment among her friends, the moment her\n",
       "back was turned.\n",
       "\n",
       "If she restrained herself abroad, however, she indemnified herself at\n",
       "home, and putting a string of rich Oriental pearls round her neck,\n",
       "Moorish bracelets on her arms, and an aigrette of diamonds on her head,\n",
       "sailed backwards and forwards in her slattern rags about the room, now\n",
       "and then stopping to admire herself in a broken mirror. Nay, in the\n",
       "impulse of her simple vanity, she could not resist, on one occasion,\n",
       "showing herself at the window to enjoy the effect of her finery on the\n",
       "passers-by.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the fates would have it, Pedrillo Pedrugo, the meddlesome barber, was\n",
       "at this moment sitting idly in his shop on the opposite side of the\n",
       "street, when his ever-watchful eye caught the sparkle of a diamond. In\n",
       "an instant he was at his loophole reconnoitring the slattern spouse of\n",
       "the water-carrier, decorated with the splendor of an eastern bride. No\n",
       "sooner had he taken an accurate inventory of her ornaments, than he\n",
       "posted off with all speed to the alcalde. In a little while the hungry\n",
       "alguazil was again on the scent, and before the day was over the\n",
       "unfortunate Peregil was once more dragged into the presence of the\n",
       "judge.\n",
       "\n",
       "“How is this, villain!” cried the alcalde, in a furious voice. “You told\n",
       "me that the infidel who died in your house left nothing behind but an\n",
       "empty coffer, and now I hear of your wife flaunting in her rags decked\n",
       "out with pearls and diamonds. Wretch that thou art! prepare to render up\n",
       "the spoils of thy miserable victim, and to swing on the gallows that is\n",
       "already tired of waiting for thee.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The terrified water-carrier fell on his knees, and made a full relation\n",
       "of the marvellous manner in which he had gained his wealth. The alcalde,\n",
       "the alguazil, and the inquisitive barber listened with greedy ears to\n",
       "this Arabian tale of enchanted treasure. The alguazil was dispatched to\n",
       "bring the Moor who had assisted in the incantation. The Moslem entered\n",
       "half frightened out of his wits at finding himself in the hands of the\n",
       "harpies of the law. When he beheld the water-carrier standing with\n",
       "sheepish looks and downcast countenance, he comprehended the whole\n",
       "matter. “Miserable animal,” said he, as he passed near him, “did I not\n",
       "warn thee against babbling to thy wife?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The story of the Moor coincided exactly with that of his colleague; but\n",
       "the alcalde affected to be slow of belief, and threw out menaces of\n",
       "imprisonment and rigorous investigation.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Softly, good Señor Alcalde,” said the Mussulman, who by this time had\n",
       "recovered his usual shrewdness and self-possession. “Let us not mar\n",
       "fortune’s favors in the scramble for them. Nobody knows anything of this\n",
       "matter but ourselves; let us keep the secret. There is wealth enough in\n",
       "the cave to enrich us all. Promise a fair division, and all shall be\n",
       "produced; refuse, and the cave shall remain forever closed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The alcalde consulted apart with the alguazil. The latter was an old fox\n",
       "in his profession. “Promise anything,” said he, “until you get\n",
       "possession of the treasure. You may then seize upon the whole, and if he\n",
       "and his accomplice dare to murmur, threaten them with the fagot and the\n",
       "stake as infidels and sorcerers.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The alcalde relished the advice. Smoothing his brow and turning to the\n",
       "Moor, “This is a strange story,” said he, “and may be true, but I must\n",
       "have ocular proof of it. This very night you must repeat the incantation\n",
       "in my presence. If there be really such treasure, we will share it\n",
       "amicably between us, and say nothing further of the matter; if ye have\n",
       "deceived me, expect no mercy at my hands. In the mean time you must\n",
       "remain in custody.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The Moor and the water-carrier cheerfully agreed to these conditions,\n",
       "satisfied that the event would prove the truth of their words.\n",
       "\n",
       "Towards midnight the alcalde sallied forth secretly, attended by the\n",
       "alguazil and the meddlesome barber, all strongly armed. They conducted\n",
       "the Moor and the water-carrier as prisoners, and were provided with the\n",
       "stout donkey of the latter to bear off the expected treasure. They\n",
       "arrived at the tower without being observed, and tying the donkey to a\n",
       "fig-tree, descended into the fourth vault of the tower.\n",
       "\n",
       "The scroll was produced, the yellow waxen taper lighted, and the Moor\n",
       "read the form of incantation. The earth trembled as before, and the\n",
       "pavement opened with a thundering sound, disclosing the narrow flight of\n",
       "steps. The alcalde, the alguazil, and the barber were struck aghast, and\n",
       "could not summon courage to descend. The Moor and the water-carrier\n",
       "entered the lower vault, and found the two Moors seated as before,\n",
       "silent and motionless. They removed two of the great jars, filled with\n",
       "golden coin and precious stones. The water-carrier bore them up one by\n",
       "one upon his shoulders, but though a strong-backed little man, and\n",
       "accustomed to carry burdens, he staggered beneath their weight, and\n",
       "found, when slung on each side of his donkey, they were as much as the\n",
       "animal could bear.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Let us be content for the present,” said the Moor; “here is as much\n",
       "treasure as we can carry off without being perceived, and enough to make\n",
       "us all wealthy to our heart’s desire.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Is there more treasure remaining behind?” demanded the alcalde.\n",
       "\n",
       "“The greatest prize of all,” said the Moor, “a huge coffer bound with\n",
       "bands of steel, and filled with pearls and precious stones.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Let us have up the coffer by all means,” cried the grasping alcalde.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I will descend for no more,” said the Moor, doggedly; “enough is enough\n",
       "for a reasonable man--more is superfluous.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And I,” said the water-carrier, “will bring up no further burden to\n",
       "break the back of my poor donkey.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Finding commands, threats, and entreaties equally vain, the alcalde\n",
       "turned to his two adherents. “Aid me,” said he, “to bring up the coffer,\n",
       "and its contents shall be divided between us.” So saying, he descended\n",
       "the steps, followed with trembling reluctance by the alguazil and the\n",
       "barber.\n",
       "\n",
       "No sooner did the Moor behold them fairly earthed than he extinguished\n",
       "the yellow taper; the pavement closed with its usual crash, and the\n",
       "three worthies remained buried in its womb.\n",
       "\n",
       "He then hastened up the different flight of steps, nor stopped until in\n",
       "the open air. The little water-carrier followed him as fast as his short\n",
       "legs would permit.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What hast thou done?” cried Peregil, as soon as he could recover\n",
       "breath. “The alcalde and the other two are shut up in the vault.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It is the will of Allah!” said the Moor, devoutly.\n",
       "\n",
       "“And will you not release them?” demanded the Gallego.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Allah forbid!” replied the Moor, smoothing his beard. “It is written in\n",
       "the book of fate that they shall remain enchanted until some future\n",
       "adventurer arrive to break the charm. The will of God be done!” so\n",
       "saying, he hurled the end of the waxen taper far among the gloomy\n",
       "thickets of the glen.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was now no remedy; so the Moor and the water-carrier proceeded\n",
       "with the richly laden donkey toward the city, nor could honest Peregil\n",

       "“The Left-handed.” Some say he was so called on account of his being\n",
       "really more expert with his sinister than his dexter hand; others,\n",
       "because he was prone to take everything by the wrong end, or, in other\n",
       "words, to mar wherever he meddled. Certain it is, either through\n",
       "misfortune or mismanagement, he was continually in trouble: thrice was\n",
       "he driven from his throne, and on one occasion barely escaped to Africa\n",
       "with his life, in the disguise of a fisherman.[18] Still he was as brave\n",

       "such purpose, that he each time re-established himself upon his throne\n",
       "by dint of hard fighting. Instead, however, of learning wisdom from\n",

       "returning from a foray into the land of the Christians. They were\n",
       "conducting a long string of mules laden with spoil, and many captives of\n",
       "both sexes, among whom the monarch was struck with the appearance of a\n",
       "beautiful damsel, richly attired, who sat weeping on a low palfrey, and\n",
       "heeded not the consoling words of a duenna who rode beside her.\n",

       "of the troop, found that she was the daughter of the alcayde of a\n",

       "evident. No sooner had the Moorish king held a little private\n",
       "conversation with her, than she saw at once the cogency of his\n",
       "reasoning, and undertook his cause with her young mistress.\n",
       "\n",

       "As usual with all Moslem monarchs, he summoned his astrologers on this\n",

       "palace, incrusted, as it were, in a powerful Moorish fortress on the\n",
       "summit of a hill overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. It was a royal\n",
       "retreat, in which the Moslem monarchs shut up such of their relatives as\n",
       "might endanger their safety; allowing them all kinds of luxuries and\n",
       "amusements, in the midst of which they passed their lives in voluptuous\n",
       "indolence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here the princesses remained, immured from the world, but surrounded by\n",
       "enjoyment, and attended by female slaves who anticipated their wishes.\n",
       "They had delightful gardens for their recreation, filled with the\n",
       "rarest fruits and flowers, with aromatic groves and perfumed baths. On\n",
       "three sides the castle looked down upon a rich valley, enamelled with\n",
       "all kinds of culture, and bounded by the lofty Alpuxarra mountains; on\n",
       "the other side it overlooked the broad sunny sea.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this delicious abode, in a propitious climate, and under a cloudless\n",
       "sky, the three princesses grew up into wondrous beauty; but, though all\n",
       "reared alike, they gave early tokens of diversity of character. Their\n",
       "names were Zayda, Zorayda, and Zorahayda; and such was their order of\n",
       "seniority, for there had been precisely three minutes between their\n",
       "births.\n",
       "\n",
       "Zayda, the eldest, was of an intrepid spirit, and took the lead of her\n",
       "sisters in everything, as she had done in entering into the world. She\n",
       "was curious and inquisitive, and fond of getting at the bottom of\n",
       "things.\n",
       "\n",
       "Zorayda had a great feeling for beauty, which was the reason, no doubt,\n",
       "of her delighting to regard her own image in a mirror or a fountain, and\n",
       "of her fondness for flowers, and jewels, and other tasteful ornaments.\n",
       "\n",
       "As to Zorahayda, the youngest, she was soft and timid, and extremely\n",
       "sensitive, with a vast deal of disposable tenderness, as was evident\n",
       "from her number of pet-flowers, and pet-birds, and pet-animals, all of\n",
       "which she cherished with the fondest care. Her amusements, too, were of\n",
       "a gentle nature, and mixed up with musing and reverie. She would sit for\n",
       "hours in a balcony, gazing on the sparkling stars of a summer’s night,\n",
       "or on the sea when lit up by the moon; and at such times, the song of a\n",
       "fisherman, faintly heard from the beach, or the notes of a Moorish flute\n",
       "from some gliding bark, sufficed to elevate her feelings into ecstasy.\n",
       "The least uproar of the elements, however, filled her with dismay; and a\n",
       "clap of thunder was enough to throw her into a swoon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Years rolled on smoothly and serenely; the discreet Kadiga, to whom the\n",
       "princesses were confided, was faithful to her trust, and attended them\n",
       "with unremitting care.\n",
       "\n",
       "The castle of Salobreña, as has been said, was built upon a hill on the\n",
       "sea-coast. One of the exterior walls straggled down the profile of the\n",
       "hill, until it reached a jutting rock overhanging the sea, with a narrow\n",
       "sandy beach at its foot, laved by the rippling billows. A small\n",
       "watch-tower on this rock had been fitted up as a pavilion, with latticed\n",
       "windows to admit the sea-breeze. Here the princesses used to pass the\n",
       "sultry hours of mid-day.\n",
       "\n",
       "The curious Zayda was one day seated at a window of the pavilion, as her\n",
       "sisters, reclining on ottomans, were taking the siesta or noontide\n",
       "slumber. Her attention was attracted to a galley which came coasting\n",
       "along, with measured strokes of the oar. As it drew near, she observed\n",
       "that it was filled with armed men. The galley anchored at the foot of\n",
       "the tower: a number of Moorish soldiers landed on the narrow beach,\n",
       "conducting several Christian prisoners. The curious Zayda awakened her\n",
       "sisters, and all three peeped cautiously through the close jalousies of\n",
       "the lattice which screened them from sight. Among the prisoners were\n",
       "three Spanish cavaliers, richly dressed. They were in the flower of\n",
       "youth, and of noble presence; and the lofty manner in which they carried\n",
       "themselves, though loaded with chains and surrounded with enemies,\n",
       "bespoke the grandeur of their souls. The princesses gazed with intense\n",
       "and breathless interest. Cooped up as they had been in this castle among\n",
       "female attendants, seeing nothing of the male sex but black slaves, or\n",
       "the rude fishermen of the sea-coast, it is not to be wondered at that\n",
       "the appearance of three gallant cavaliers, in the pride of youth and\n",
       "manly beauty, should produce some commotion in their bosom.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Did ever nobler being tread the earth than that cavalier in crimson?”\n",
       "cried Zayda, the eldest of the sisters. “See how proudly he bears\n",
       "himself, as though all around him were his slaves!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But notice that one in green!” exclaimed Zorayda. “What grace! what\n",
       "elegance! what spirit!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The gentle Zorahayda said nothing, but she secretly gave preference to\n",
       "the cavalier in blue.\n",
       "\n",
       "The princesses remained gazing until the prisoners were out of sight;\n",
       "then heaving long-drawn sighs, they turned round, looked at each other\n",
       "for a moment, and sat down, musing and pensive, on their ottomans.\n",
       "\n",
       "The discreet Kadiga found them in this situation; they related what they\n",
       "had seen, and even the withered heart of the duenna was warmed. “Poor\n",
       "youths!” exclaimed she, “I’ll warrant their captivity makes many a fair\n",
       "and high-born lady’s heart ache in their native land! Ah! my children,\n",
       "you have little idea of the life these cavaliers lead in their own\n",
       "country. Such prankling at tournaments! such devotion to the ladies!\n",
       "such courting and serenading!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The curiosity of Zayda was fully aroused; she was insatiable in her\n",
       "inquiries, and drew from the duenna the most animated pictures of the\n",
       "scenes of her youthful days and native land. The beautiful Zorayda\n",
       "bridled up, and slyly regarded herself in a mirror, when the theme\n",
       "turned upon the charms of the Spanish ladies; while Zorahayda suppressed\n",
       "a struggling sigh at the mention of moonlight serenades.\n",
       "\n",
       "Every day the curious Zayda renewed her inquiries, and every day the\n",
       "sage duenna repeated her stories, which were listened to with profound\n",
       "interest, though with frequent sighs, by her gentle auditors. The\n",
       "discreet old woman awoke at length to the mischief she might be doing.\n",
       "She had been accustomed to think of the princesses only as children; but\n",
       "they had imperceptibly ripened beneath her eye, and now bloomed before\n",
       "her three lovely damsels of the marriageable age. It is time, thought\n",
       "the duenna, to give notice to the king.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mohamed the Left-handed was seated one morning on a divan in a cool hall\n",
       "of the Alhambra, when a slave arrived from the fortress of Salobreña,\n",
       "with a message from the sage Kadiga, congratulating him on the\n",
       "anniversary of his daughters’ birth-day. The slave at the same time\n",
       "presented a delicate little basket decorated with flowers, within which,\n",
       "on a couch of vine and fig-leaves, lay a peach, an apricot, and a\n",
       "nectarine, with their bloom and down and dewy sweetness upon them, and\n",
       "all in the early stage of tempting ripeness. The monarch was versed in\n",
       "the Oriental language of fruits and flowers, and rapidly divined the\n",
       "meaning of this emblematical offering.\n",
       "\n",
       "“So,” said he, “the critical period pointed out by the astrologers is\n",
       "arrived: my daughters are at a marriageable age. What is to be done?\n",
       "They are shut up from the eyes of men; they are under the eyes of the\n",
       "discreet Kadiga,--all very good,--but still they are not under my own\n",
       "eye, as was prescribed by the astrologers: I must gather them under my\n",
       "wing, and trust to no other guardianship.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So saying, he ordered that a tower of the Alhambra should be prepared\n",
       "for their reception, and departed at the head of his guards for the\n",
       "fortress of Salobreña, to conduct them home in person.\n",
       "\n",
       "About three years had elapsed since Mohamed had beheld his daughters,\n",
       "and he could scarcely credit his eyes at the wonderful change which that\n",
       "small space of time had made in their appearance. During the interval,\n",
       "they had passed that wondrous boundary line in female life which\n",
       "separates the crude, unformed, and thoughtless girl from the blooming,\n",
       "blushing, meditative woman. It is like passing from the flat, bleak,\n",
       "uninteresting plains of La Mancha to the voluptuous valleys and swelling\n",
       "hills of Andalusia.\n",
       "\n",
       "Zayda was tall and finely formed, with a lofty demeanor and a\n",
       "penetrating eye. She entered with a stately and decided step, and made a\n",
       "profound reverence to Mohamed, treating him more as her sovereign than\n",
       "her father. Zorayda was of the middle height, with an alluring look and\n",
       "swimming gait, and a sparkling beauty, heightened by the assistance of\n",
       "the toilette. She approached her father with a smile, kissed his hand,\n",
       "and saluted him with several stanzas from a popular Arabian poet, with\n",
       "which the monarch was delighted. Zorahayda was shy and timid, smaller\n",
       "than her sisters, and with a beauty of that tender beseeching kind which\n",
       "looks for fondness and protection. She was little fitted to command,\n",
       "like her elder sister, or to dazzle like the second, but was rather\n",
       "formed to creep to the bosom of manly affection, to nestle within it,\n",
       "and be content. She drew near to her father, with a timid and almost\n",
       "faltering step, and would have taken his hand to kiss, but on looking up\n",
       "into his face, and seeing it beaming with a paternal smile, the\n",
       "tenderness of her nature broke forth, and she threw herself upon his\n",
       "neck.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mohamed the Left-handed surveyed his blooming daughters with mingled\n",
       "pride and perplexity, for while he exulted in their charms, he bethought\n",
       "himself of the prediction of the astrologers. “Three daughters! three\n",
       "daughters!” muttered he repeatedly to himself, “and all of a\n",
       "marriageable age! Here’s tempting Hesperian fruit, that requires a\n",
       "dragon watch!”\n",
       "\n",
       "He prepared for his return to Granada, by sending heralds before him,\n",
       "commanding every one to keep out of the road by which he was to pass,\n",
       "and that all doors and windows should be closed at the approach of the\n",
       "princesses. This done, he set forth, escorted by a troop of black\n",
       "horsemen of hideous aspect, and clad in shining armor.\n",
       "\n",
       "The princesses rode beside the king, closely veiled, on beautiful white\n",
       "palfreys, with velvet caparisons, embroidered with gold, and sweeping\n",
       "the ground; the bits and stirrups were of gold, and the silken bridles\n",
       "adorned with pearls and precious stones. The palfreys were covered with\n",
       "little silver bells, which made the most musical tinkling as they ambled\n",
       "gently along. Woe to the unlucky wight, however, who lingered in the way\n",
       "when he heard the tinkling of these bells!--the guards were ordered to\n",
       "cut him down without mercy.\n",
       "\n",
       "The cavalcade was drawing near to Granada, when it overtook, on the\n",
       "banks of the river Xenil, a small body of Moorish soldiers with a convoy\n",
       "of prisoners. It was too late for the soldiers to get out of the way, so\n",
       "they threw themselves on their faces on the earth, ordering their\n",
       "captives to do the like. Among the prisoners were the three identical\n",
       "cavaliers whom the princesses had seen from the pavilion. They either\n",
       "did not understand, or were too haughty to obey the order, and remained\n",
       "standing and gazing upon the cavalcade as it approached.\n",
       "\n",
       "The ire of the monarch was kindled at this flagrant defiance of his\n",
       "orders. Drawing his cimeter, and pressing forward, he was about to deal\n",
       "a left-handed blow that might have been fatal to at least one of the\n",
       "gazers, when the princesses crowded round him, and implored mercy for\n",
       "the prisoners; even the timid Zorahayda forgot her shyness, and became\n",
       "eloquent in their behalf. Mohamed paused, with uplifted cimeter, when\n",
       "the captain of the guard threw himself at his feet. “Let not your\n",
       "highness,” said he, “do a deed that may cause great scandal throughout\n",
       "the kingdom. These are three brave and noble Spanish knights, who have\n",
       "been taken in battle, fighting like lions; they are of high birth, and\n",
       "may bring great ransoms.”--“Enough!” said the king. “I will spare their\n",
       "lives, but punish their audacity--let them be taken to the Vermilion\n",
       "Towers, and put to hard labor.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Mohamed was making one of his usual left-handed blunders. In the tumult\n",
       "and agitation of this blustering scene, the veils of the three\n",
       "princesses had been thrown back, and the radiance of their beauty\n",
       "revealed; and in prolonging the parley, the king had given that beauty\n",
       "time to have its full effect. In those days people fell in love much\n",
       "more suddenly than at present, as all ancient stories make manifest: it\n",
       "is not a matter of wonder, therefore, that the hearts of the three\n",
       "cavaliers were completely captured; especially as gratitude was added to\n",
       "their admiration; it is a little singular, however, though no less\n",
       "certain, that each of them was enraptured with a several beauty. As to\n",
       "the princesses, they were more than ever struck with the noble demeanor\n",
       "of the captives, and cherished in their breasts all that they had heard\n",
       "of their valor and noble lineage.\n",
       "\n",
       "The cavalcade resumed its march; the three princesses rode pensively\n",
       "along on their tinkling palfreys, now and then stealing a glance behind\n",
       "in search of the Christian captives, and the latter were conducted to\n",
       "their allotted prison in the Vermilion Towers.\n",
       "\n",
       "The residence provided for the princesses was one of the most dainty\n",
       "that fancy could devise. It was in a tower somewhat apart from the main\n",
       "palace of the Alhambra, though connected with it by the wall which\n",
       "encircled the whole summit of the hill. On one side it looked into the\n",
       "interior of the fortress, and had, at its foot, a small garden filled\n",
       "with the rarest flowers. On the other side it overlooked a deep\n",
       "embowered ravine separating the grounds of the Alhambra from those of\n",
       "the Generalife. The interior of the tower was divided into small fairy\n",
       "apartments, beautifully ornamented in the light Arabian style,\n",
       "surrounding a lofty hall, the vaulted roof of which rose almost to the\n",
       "summit of the tower. The walls and the ceilings of the hall were adorned\n",
       "with arabesque and fretwork, sparkling with gold and with brilliant\n",
       "pencilling. In the centre of the marble pavement was an alabaster\n",
       "fountain, set round with aromatic shrubs and flowers, and throwing up a\n",
       "jet of water that cooled the whole edifice and had a lulling sound.\n",
       "Round the hall were suspended cages of gold and silver wire, containing\n",
       "singing birds of the finest plumage or sweetest note.\n",
       "\n",
       "The princesses had been represented as always cheerful when in the\n",
       "castle of the Salobreña; the king had expected to see them enraptured\n",
       "with the Alhambra. To his surprise, however, they began to pine, and\n",
       "grow melancholy, and dissatisfied with everything around them. The\n",
       "flowers yielded them no fragrance, the song of the nightingale disturbed\n",
       "their night’s rest, and they were out of all patience with the alabaster\n",
       "fountain, with its eternal drop-drop and splash-splash, from morning\n",
       "till night and from night till morning.\n",
       "\n",
       "The king, who was somewhat of a testy, tyrannical disposition, took this\n",
       "at first in high dudgeon; but he reflected that his daughters had\n",
       "arrived at an age when the female mind expands and its desires augment.\n",
       "“They are no longer children,” said he to himself, “they are women\n",
       "grown, and require suitable objects to interest them.” He put in\n",
       "requisition, therefore, all the dressmakers, and the jewellers, and the\n",
       "artificers in gold and silver throughout the Zacatin of Granada, and the\n",
       "princesses were overwhelmed with robes of silk, and tissue, and brocade,\n",
       "and cashmere shawls, and necklaces of pearls and diamonds, and rings,\n",
       "and bracelets, and anklets, and all manner of precious things.\n",
       "\n",
       "All, however, was of no avail; the princesses continued pale and languid\n",
       "in the midst of their finery, and looked like three blighted rose-buds,\n",
       "drooping from one stalk. The king was at his wits’ end. He had in\n",
       "general a laudable confidence in his own judgment, and never took\n",
       "advice. “The whims and caprices of three marriageable damsels, however,\n",
       "are sufficient,” said he, “to puzzle the shrewdest head.” So for once in\n",
       "his life he called in the aid of counsel.\n",
       "\n",
       "The person to whom he applied was the experienced duenna.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Kadiga,” said the king, “I know you to be one of the most discreet\n",
       "women in the whole world, as well as one of the most trustworthy; for\n",
       "these reasons I have always continued you about the persons of my\n",
       "daughters. Fathers cannot be too wary in whom they repose such\n",
       "confidence; I now wish you to find out the secret malady that is preying\n",
       "upon the princesses, and to devise some means of restoring them to\n",
       "health and cheerfulness.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Kadiga promised implicit obedience. In fact she knew more of the malady\n",
       "of the princesses than they themselves. Shutting herself up with them,\n",
       "however, she endeavored to insinuate herself into their confidence.\n",
       "\n",
       "“My dear children, what is the reason you are so dismal and downcast in\n",
       "so beautiful a place, where you have everything that heart can wish?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The princesses looked vacantly round the apartment, and sighed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What more, then, would you have? Shall I get you the wonderful parrot\n",
       "that talks all languages, and is the delight of Granada?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Odious!” exclaimed the princess Zayda. “A horrid, screaming bird, that\n",
       "chatters words without ideas: one must be without brains to tolerate\n",
       "such a pest.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Shall I send for a monkey from the rock of Gibraltar, to divert you\n",
       "with his antics?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A monkey! faugh!” cried Zorayda; “the detestable mimic of man. I hate\n",
       "the nauseous animal.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What say you to the famous black singer Casem, from the royal harem, in\n",
       "Morocco? They say he has a voice as fine as a woman’s.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I am terrified at the sight of these black slaves,” said the delicate\n",
       "Zorahayda; “besides, I have lost all relish for music.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ah! my child, you would not say so,” replied the old woman, slyly, “had\n",
       "you heard the music I heard last evening, from the three Spanish\n",
       "cavaliers whom we met on our journey. But bless me, children! what is\n",
       "the matter that you blush so and are in such a flutter?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nothing, nothing, good mother; pray proceed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well; as I was passing by the Vermilion Towers last evening, I saw the\n",
       "three cavaliers resting after their day’s labor. One was playing on the\n",
       "guitar, so gracefully, and the others sang by turns; and they did it in\n",
       "such style, that the very guards seemed like statues, or men enchanted.\n",
       "Allah forgive me! I could not help being moved at hearing the songs of\n",
       "my native country. And then to see three such noble and handsome youths\n",
       "in chains and slavery!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Here the kind-hearted old woman could not restrain her tears.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Perhaps, mother, you could manage to procure us a sight of these\n",
       "cavaliers,” said Zayda.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I think,” said Zorayda, “a little music would be quite reviving.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The timid Zorahayda said nothing, but threw her arms round the neck of\n",
       "Kadiga.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Mercy on me!” exclaimed the discreet old woman; “what are you talking\n",
       "of, my children? Your father would be the death of us all if he heard of\n",
       "such a thing. To be sure, these cavaliers are evidently well-bred, and\n",
       "high-minded youths; but what of that? they are the enemies of our faith,\n",
       "and you must not even think of them but with abhorrence.”\n",
       "\n",
       "There is an admirable intrepidity in the female will, particularly when\n",
       "about the marriageable age, which is not to be deterred by dangers and\n",
       "prohibitions. The princesses hung round their old duenna, and coaxed,\n",
       "and entreated, and declared that a refusal would break their hearts.\n",
       "\n",
       "What could she do? She was certainly the most discreet old woman in the\n",
       "whole world, and one of the most faithful servants to the king; but was\n",
       "she to see three beautiful princesses break their hearts for the mere\n",
       "tinkling of a guitar? Besides, though she had been so long among the\n",
       "Moors, and changed her faith in imitation of her mistress, like a trusty\n",
       "follower, yet she was a Spaniard born, and had the lingerings of\n",
       "Christianity in her heart. So she set about to contrive how the wish of\n",
       "the princesses might be gratified.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Christian captives, confined in the Vermilion Towers, were under the\n",
       "charge of a big-whiskered, broad-shouldered renegado, called Hussein\n",
       "Baba, who was reputed to have a most itching palm. She went to him\n",
       "privately, and slipping a broad piece of gold into his hand, “Hussein\n",
       "Baba,” said she; “my mistresses the three princesses, who are shut up in\n",
       "the tower, and in sad want of amusement, have heard of the musical\n",
       "talents of the three Spanish cavaliers, and are desirous of hearing a\n",
       "specimen of their skill. I am sure you are too kind-hearted to refuse\n",
       "them so innocent a gratification.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What! and to have my head set grinning over the gate of my own tower!\n",
       "for that would be the reward, if the king should discover it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No danger of anything of the kind; the affair may be managed so that\n",
       "the whim of the princesses may be gratified, and their father be never\n",
       "the wiser. You know the deep ravine outside of the walls which passes\n",
       "immediately below the tower. Put the three Christians to work there, and\n",
       "at the intervals of their labor, let them play and sing, as if for their\n",
       "own recreation. In this way the princesses will be able to hear them\n",
       "from the windows of the tower, and you may be sure of their paying well\n",
       "for your compliance.”\n",
       "\n",
       "As the good old woman concluded her harangue, she kindly pressed the\n",
       "rough hand of the renegado, and left within it another piece of gold.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her eloquence was irresistible. The very next day the three cavaliers\n",
       "were put to work in the ravine. During the noontide heat, when their\n",
       "fellow-laborers were sleeping in the shade, and the guard nodding\n",
       "drowsily at his post, they seated themselves among the herbage at the\n",
       "foot of the tower, and sang a Spanish roundelay to the accompaniment of\n",
       "the guitar.\n",
       "\n",
       "The glen was deep, the tower was high, but their voices rose distinctly\n",
       "in the stillness of the summer noon. The princesses listened from their\n",
       "balcony, they had been taught the Spanish language by their duenna, and\n",
       "were moved by the tenderness of the song. The discreet Kadiga, on the\n",
       "contrary, was terribly shocked. “Allah preserve us!” cried she, “they\n",
       "are singing a love-ditty, addressed to yourselves. Did ever mortal hear\n",
       "of such audacity? I will run to the slave-master, and have them soundly\n",
       "bastinadoed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What! bastinado such gallant cavaliers, and for singing so charmingly!”\n",
       "The three beautiful princesses were filled with horror at the idea. With\n",
       "all her virtuous indignation, the good old woman was of a placable\n",
       "nature, and easily appeased. Besides, the music seemed to have a\n",
       "beneficial effect upon her young mistresses. A rosy bloom had already\n",
       "come to their cheeks, and their eyes began to sparkle. She made no\n",
       "further objection, therefore, to the amorous ditty of the cavaliers.\n",
       "\n",
       "When it was finished, the princesses remained silent for a time; at\n",
       "length Zorayda took up a lute, and with a sweet, though faint and\n",
       "trembling voice, warbled a little Arabian air, the burden of which was,\n",
       "“The rose is concealed among her leaves, but she listens with delight to\n",
       "the song of the nightingale.”\n",
       "\n",
       "From this time forward the cavaliers worked almost daily in the ravine.\n",
       "The considerate Hussein Baba became more and more indulgent, and daily\n",
       "more prone to sleep at his post. For some time a vague intercourse was\n",
       "kept up by popular songs and romances, which in some measure responded\n",
       "to each other, and breathed the feelings of the parties. By degrees the\n",
       "princesses showed themselves at the balcony, when they could do so\n",
       "without being perceived by the guards. They conversed with the cavaliers\n",
       "also, by means of flowers, with the symbolical language of which they\n",
       "were mutually acquainted; the difficulties of their intercourse added to\n",
       "its charms, and strengthened the passion they had so singularly\n",
       "conceived; for love delights to struggle with difficulties, and thrives\n",
       "the most hardily on the scantiest soil.\n",
       "\n",
       "The change effected in the looks and spirits of the princesses by this\n",
       "secret intercourse, surprised and gratified the left-handed king; but no\n",
       "one was more elated than the discreet Kadiga, who considered it all\n",
       "owing to her able management.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length there was an interruption in this telegraphic correspondence:\n",
       "for several days the cavaliers ceased to make their appearance in the\n",
       "glen. The princesses looked out from the tower in vain. In vain they\n",
       "stretched their swan-like necks from the balcony; in vain they sang like\n",
       "captive nightingales in their cage: nothing was to be seen of their\n",
       "Christian lovers; not a note responded from the groves. The discreet\n",
       "Kadiga sallied forth in quest of intelligence, and soon returned with a\n",
       "face full of trouble. “Ah, my children!” cried she, “I saw what all this\n",
       "would come to, but you would have your way; you may now hang up your\n",
       "lutes on the willows. The Spanish cavaliers are ransomed by their\n",
       "families; they are down in Granada, and preparing to return to their\n",
       "native country.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The three beautiful princesses were in despair at the tidings. Zayda was\n",
       "indignant at the slight put upon them, in thus being deserted without a\n",
       "parting word. Zorayda wrung her hands and cried, and looked in the\n",
       "glass, and wiped away her tears, and cried afresh. The gentle Zorahayda\n",
       "leaned over the balcony and wept in silence, and her tears fell drop by\n",
       "drop among the flowers of the bank where the faithless cavaliers had so\n",
       "often been seated.\n",
       "\n",
       "The discreet Kadiga did all in her power to soothe their sorrow. “Take\n",
       "comfort, my children,” said she, “this is nothing when you are used to\n",
       "it. This is the way of the world. Ah! when you are as old as I am, you\n",
       "will know how to value these men. I’ll warrant these cavaliers have\n",
       "their loves among the Spanish beauties of Cordova and Seville, and will\n",
       "soon be serenading under their balconies, and thinking no more of the\n",
       "Moorish beauties in the Alhambra. Take comfort, therefore, my children,\n",
       "and drive them from your hearts.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The comforting words of the discreet Kadiga only redoubled the distress\n",
       "of the three princesses, and for two days they continued inconsolable.\n",
       "On the morning of the third the good old woman entered their apartment,\n",
       "all ruffling with indignation.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Who would have believed such insolence in mortal man!” exclaimed she,\n",
       "as soon as she could find words to express herself; “but I am rightly\n",
       "served for having connived at this deception of your worthy father.\n",
       "Never talk more to me of your Spanish cavaliers.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why, what has happened, good Kadiga?” exclaimed the princesses in\n",
       "breathless anxiety.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What has happened?--treason has happened! or, what is almost as bad,\n",
       "treason has been proposed; and to me, the most faithful of subjects, the\n",
       "trustiest of duennas! Yes, my children, the Spanish cavaliers have dared\n",
       "to tamper with me, that I should persuade you to fly with them to\n",
       "Cordova, and become their wives!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Here the excellent old woman covered her face with her hands, and gave\n",
       "way to a violent burst of grief and indignation. The three beautiful\n",
       "princesses turned pale and red, pale and red, and trembled, and looked\n",
       "down, and cast shy looks at each other, but said nothing. Meantime the\n",
       "old woman sat rocking backward and forward in violent agitation, and now\n",
       "and then breaking out into exclamations,--“That ever I should live to be\n",
       "so insulted!--I, the most faithful of servants!”\n",
       "\n",
       "At length the eldest princess, who had most spirit and always took the\n",

       "\n",

       "cavaliers already bribed Hussein Baba, the renegado captain of the\n",
       "guard, and arranged the whole plan? But, then, to think of deceiving\n",
       "your father! your father, who has placed such confidence in me!” Here\n",
       "the worthy woman gave way to a fresh burst of grief, and began again to\n",
       "rock backward and forward, and to wring her hands.\n",

       "\n",
       "“Why, that is true enough,” replied the old woman, again pausing in her\n",
       "grief; “he has indeed treated you most unreasonably, keeping you shut up\n",
       "here, to waste your bloom in a moping old tower, like roses left to\n",

       "passage. They groped their way through a fearful labyrinth, cut through\n",
       "the heart of the mountain, and succeeded in reaching, undiscovered, an\n",

       "said he, “there is no one on our traces, we shall make good our escape\n",
       "to the mountains.” While he spoke, a light blaze sprang up on the top of\n",
       "the watch-tower of the Alhambra.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Confusion!” cried the renegado, “that bale fire will put all the guards\n",

       "to be lost.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Away they dashed--the clattering of their horses’ hoofs echoed from rock\n",
       "to rock, as they swept along the road that skirts the rocky mountain of\n",
       "Elvira. As they galloped on, the bale fire of the Alhambra was answered\n",
       "in every direction; light after light blazed on the Atalayas, or\n",
       "watch-towers of the mountains.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Forward! forward!” cried the renegado, with many an oath, “to the\n",

       "\n",
       "They doubled the promontory of the mountains, and arrived in sight of\n",
       "the famous Bridge of Pinos, that crosses a rushing stream often dyed\n",
       "with Christian and Moslem blood. To their confusion, the tower on the\n",
       "bridge blazed with lights and glittered with armed men. The renegado\n",
       "pulled up his steed, rose in his stirrups and looked about him for a\n",
       "moment; then beckoning to the cavaliers, he struck off from the road,\n",
       "skirted the river for some distance, and dashed into its waters. The\n",
       "cavaliers called upon the princesses to cling to them, and did the same.\n",
       "They were borne for some distance down the rapid current, the surges\n",
       "roared round them, but the beautiful princesses clung to their Christian\n",
       "knights, and never uttered a complaint. The cavaliers attained the\n",
       "opposite bank in safety, and were conducted by the renegado, by rude and\n",
       "unfrequented paths and wild barrancos, through the heart of the\n",
       "mountains, so as to avoid all the regular passes. In a word, they\n",
       "succeeded in reaching the ancient city of Cordova; where their\n",
       "restoration to their country and friends was celebrated with great\n",
       "rejoicings, for they were of the noblest families. The beautiful\n",
       "princesses were forthwith received into the bosom of the Church, and,\n",
       "after being in all due form made regular Christians, were rendered happy\n",
       "wives.\n",
       "\n",
       "In our hurry to make good the escape of the princesses across the river,\n",
       "and up the mountains, we forgot to mention the fate of the discreet\n",
       "Kadiga. She had clung like a cat to Hussein Baba in the scamper across\n",
       "the Vega, screaming at every bound, and drawing many an oath from the\n",
       "whiskered renegado; but when he prepared to plunge his steed into the\n",
       "river, her terror knew no bounds. “Grasp me not so tightly,” cried\n",

       "mountain summit, the duenna was no longer to be seen.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What has become of Kadiga?” cried the princesses in alarm.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Allah alone knows!” replied the renegado; “my belt came loose when in\n",
       "the midst of the river, and Kadiga was swept with it down the stream.\n",
       "The will of Allah be done! but it was an embroidered belt, and of great\n",
       "price.”\n",
       "\n",
       "There was no time to waste in idle regrets; yet bitterly did the\n",
       "princesses bewail the loss of their discreet counsellor. That excellent\n",

       "water: a fisherman, who was drawing his nets some distance down the\n",
       "stream, brought her to land, and was not a little astonished at his\n",
       "miraculous draught. What further became of the discreet Kadiga, the\n",

       "For some time after the surrender of Granada by the Moors, that\n",

       "Many, many years then rolled away, during which Granada was rarely\n",
       "honored by a royal guest. The palaces of the nobility remained silent\n",
       "and shut up; and the Alhambra, like a slighted beauty, sat in mournful\n",
       "desolation among her neglected gardens. The tower of the Infantas, once\n",
       "the residence of the three beautiful Moorish princesses, partook of the\n",
       "general desolation; the spider spun her web athwart the gilded vault,\n",
       "and bats and owls nestled in those chambers that had been graced by the\n",
       "presence of Zayda, Zorayda, and Zorahayda. The neglect of this tower may\n",

       "At length the city of Granada was once more welcomed by the royal\n",

       "about barbican and battlement, recalled the ancient and warlike glories\n",

       "page of the queen was at once to speak his eulogium, for every one in\n",

       "course of his rambles, seeing a bird rising from a thicket, he unhooded\n",
       "the hawk and let him fly. The falcon towered high in the air, made a\n",
       "swoop at his quarry, but missing it, soared away, regardless of the\n",
       "calls of the page. The latter followed the truant bird with his eye, in\n",

       "The page descended into the ravine and approached the tower, but it had\n",

       "\n",
       "A small garden, enclosed by a trellis-work of reeds overhung with\n",

       "beds of flowers and thickets of roses to the door. It was closed and\n",
       "bolted. A crevice in the door gave him a peep into the interior. There\n",
       "was a small Moorish hall with fretted walls, light marble columns, and\n",
       "an alabaster fountain surrounded with flowers. In the centre hung a gilt\n",
       "cage containing a singing-bird; beneath it, on a chair, lay a\n",

       "\n",
       "He knocked gently at the door. A beautiful face peeped out from a little\n",

       "within--all was silent. Had his senses deceived him, or was this\n",
       "beautiful apparition the fairy of the tower? He knocked again, and more\n",

       "\n",
       "Towards midnight, when everything was quiet, she again took her seat in\n",

       "the midnight hour, the fountain was again agitated; and\n",
       "bubble--bubble--bubble--it tossed about the waters until the Moorish\n",
       "female again rose to view. She was young and beautiful; her dress was\n",
       "rich with jewels, and in her hand she held a silver lute. Jacinta\n",
       "trembled and was faint, but was reassured by the soft and plaintive\n",

       "melancholy countenance.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Daughter of mortality,” said she, “what aileth thee? Why do thy tears\n",

       "the evil genii are permitted to have power over me, and I remain\n",
       "enchanted in this tower until some pure Christian will deign to break\n",

       "descending into the hall, however, the truth of the vision was\n",
       "established, for beside the fountain she beheld the silver lute\n",
       "glittering in the morning sunshine.\n",
       "\n",
       "She hastened to her aunt, to relate all that had befallen her, and\n",

       "story. If the good lady had any lingering doubts, they were removed when\n",

       "perplexity, began to grow impatient, and to revile bitterly at them for\n",
       "negligence and disrespect, in leaving him unburied. What was to be done?\n",

       "Impatient to make trial of her skill, she led the way at once to the\n",

       "\n",
       "Jacinta followed with downcast eyes through files of guards and crowds\n",
       "of courtiers. They arrived at length at a great chamber hung with black.\n",
       "The windows were closed to exclude the light of day: a number of yellow\n",
       "wax tapers in silver sconces diffused a lugubrious light, and dimly\n",
       "revealed the figures of mutes in mourning dresses, and courtiers who\n",
       "glided about with noiseless step and woe-begone visage. In the midst of\n",
       "a funeral bed or bier, his hands folded on his breast, and the tip of\n",
       "his nose just visible, lay extended this would-be-buried monarch.\n",
       "\n",
       "The queen entered the chamber in silence, and pointing to a footstool in\n",
       "an obscure corner, beckoned to Jacinta to sit down and commence.\n",
       "\n",
       "At first she touched her lute with a faltering hand, but gathering\n",
       "confidence and animation as she proceeded, drew forth such soft aërial\n",
       "harmony, that all present could scarce believe it mortal. As to the\n",
       "monarch, who had already considered himself in the world of spirits, he\n",
       "set it down for some angelic melody or the music of the spheres. By\n",
       "degrees the theme was varied, and the voice of the minstrel accompanied\n",
       "the instrument. She poured forth one of the legendary ballads treating\n",
       "of the ancient glories of the Alhambra and the achievements of the\n",
       "Moors. Her whole soul entered into the theme, for with the recollections\n",
       "of the Alhambra was associated the story of her love. The\n",
       "funeral-chamber resounded with the animating strain. It entered into the\n",
       "gloomy heart of the monarch. He raised his head and gazed around; he sat\n",
       "up on his couch, his eye began to kindle--at length, leaping upon the\n",

       "\n",
       "The triumph of music, or rather of the enchanted lute, was complete; the\n",
       "demon of melancholy was cast forth; and, as it were, a dead man brought\n",
       "to life. The windows of the apartment were thrown open; the glorious\n",
       "effulgence of Spanish sunshine burst into the late lugubrious chamber;\n",
       "all eyes sought the lovely enchantress, but the lute had fallen from her\n",
       "hand, she had sunk upon the earth, and the next moment was clasped to\n",
       "the bosom of Ruyz de Alarcon.\n",
       "\n",
       "The nuptials of the happy couple were celebrated soon afterwards with\n",

       "exclaim; “this is jumping to the end of a story at a furious rate! First\n",
       "let us know how Ruyz de Alarcon managed to account to Jacinta for his\n",
       "long neglect?” Nothing more easy; the venerable, time-honored excuse,\n",
       "the opposition to his wishes by a proud, pragmatical old father:\n",

       "\n",
       "Oh! as to that, his scruples were easily overcome by a word or two from\n",
       "the queen; especially as dignities and rewards were showered upon the\n",
       "blooming favorite of royalty. Besides, the lute of Jacinta, you know,\n",
       "possessed a magic power, and could control the most stubborn head and\n",
       "hardest breast.\n",
       "\n",
       "And what came of the enchanted lute?\n",
       "\n",
       "Oh, that is the most curious matter of all, and plainly proves the truth\n",
       "of the whole story. That lute remained for some time in the family, but\n",
       "was purloined and carried off, as was supposed, by the great singer\n",
       "Farinelli, in pure jealousy. At his death it passed into other hands in\n",
       "Italy, who were ignorant of its mystic powers, and melting down the\n",
       "silver, transferred the strings to an old Cremona fiddle. The strings\n",
       "still retain something of their magic virtues. A word in the reader’s\n",
       "ear, but let it go no further: that fiddle is now bewitching the whole\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Among the curious acquaintances I made in my rambles about the fortress,\n",
       "was a brave and battered old colonel of Invalids, who was nestled like a\n",
       "hawk in one of the Moorish towers. His history, which he was fond of\n",
       "telling, was a tissue of those adventures, mishaps, and vicissitudes\n",
       "that render the life of almost every Spaniard of note as varied and\n",
       "whimsical as the pages of Gil Blas.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was in America at twelve years of age, and reckoned among the most\n",
       "signal and fortunate events of his life, his having seen General\n",
       "Washington. Since then he had taken a part in all the wars of his\n",
       "country; he could speak experimentally of most of the prisons and\n",
       "dungeons of the Peninsula; had been lamed of one leg, crippled in his\n",
       "hands, and so cut up and carbonadoed that he was a kind of walking\n",
       "monument of the troubles of Spain, on which there was a scar for every\n",
       "battle and broil, as every year of captivity was notched upon the tree\n",
       "of Robinson Crusoe. The greatest misfortune of the brave old cavalier,\n",
       "however, appeared to have been his having commanded at Malaga during a\n",
       "time of peril and confusion, and been made a general by the inhabitants,\n",
       "to protect them from the invasion of the French. This had entailed upon\n",
       "him a number of just claims upon government, that I feared would employ\n",
       "him until his dying day in writing and printing petitions and memorials,\n",
       "to the great disquiet of his mind, exhaustion of his purse, and penance\n",
       "of his friends; not one of whom could visit him without having to listen\n",
       "to a mortal document of half an hour in length, and to carry away half\n",
       "a dozen pamphlets in his pocket. This, however, is the case throughout\n",
       "Spain; everywhere you meet with some worthy wight brooding in a corner,\n",
       "and nursing up some pet grievance and cherished wrong. Besides, a\n",

       "considered as furnished with employment for the remainder of his life.\n",
       "\n",
       "I visited the veteran in his quarters in the upper part of the Torre del\n",
       "Vino, or Wine Tower. His room was small but snug, and commanded a\n",
       "beautiful view of the Vega. It was arranged with a soldier’s precision.\n",
       "Three muskets and a brace of pistols, all bright and shining, were\n",
       "suspended against the wall, with a sabre and a cane hanging side by\n",
       "side, and above them two cocked hats, one for parade, and one for\n",

       "his library, one of which, a little old mouldy volume of philosophical\n",

       "by day; applying every maxim to his own particular case, provided it had\n",

       "THE GOVERNOR AND THE NOTARY\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "In former times there ruled, as governor of the Alhambra, a doughty old\n",
       "cavalier, who, from having lost one arm in the wars, was commonly known\n",
       "by the name of el Gobernador Manco, or “the one-armed governor.” He in\n",
       "fact prided himself upon being an old soldier, wore his moustaches\n",
       "curled up to his eyes, a pair of campaigning boots, and a toledo as long\n",
       "as a spit, with his pocket-handkerchief in the basket-hilt.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was, moreover, exceedingly proud and punctilious, and tenacious of\n",
       "all his privileges and dignities. Under his sway the immunities of the\n",
       "Alhambra, as a royal residence and domain, were rigidly exacted. No one\n",
       "was permitted to enter the fortress with fire-arms, or even with a sword\n",
       "or staff, unless he were of a certain rank; and every horseman was\n",
       "obliged to dismount at the gate, and lead his horse by the bridle. Now\n",
       "as the hill of the Alhambra rises from the very midst of the city of\n",
       "Granada, being, as it were, an excrescence of the capital, it must at\n",
       "all times be somewhat irksome to the captain-general, who commands the\n",
       "province, to have thus an _imperium in imperio_, a petty independent\n",
       "post in the very centre of his domains. It was rendered the more\n",
       "galling, in the present instance, from the irritable jealousy of the old\n",
       "governor, that took fire on the least question of authority and\n",
       "jurisdiction; and from the loose vagrant character of the people who had\n",
       "gradually nestled themselves within the fortress, as in a sanctuary, and\n",
       "thence carried on a system of roguery and depredation at the expense of\n",
       "the honest inhabitants of the city.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus there was a perpetual feud and heart-burning between the\n",
       "captain-general and the governor, the more virulent on the part of the\n",
       "latter, inasmuch as the smallest of two neighboring potentates is always\n",
       "the most captious about his dignity. The stately palace of the\n",
       "captain-general stood in the Plaza Nueva, immediately at the foot of the\n",
       "hill of the Alhambra; and here was always a bustle and parade of guards,\n",
       "and domestics, and city functionaries. A beetling bastion of the\n",
       "fortress overlooked the palace and public square in front of it; and on\n",
       "this bastion the old governor would occasionally strut backwards and\n",
       "forwards, with his toledo girded by his side, keeping a wary eye down\n",
       "upon his rival, like a hawk reconnoitring his quarry from his nest in a\n",
       "dry tree.\n",
       "\n",
       "Whenever he descended into the city, it was in grand parade; on\n",
       "horseback, surrounded by his guards; or in his state coach, an ancient\n",
       "and unwieldy Spanish edifice of carved timber and gilt leather, drawn by\n",
       "eight mules, with running footmen, outriders, and lackeys; on which\n",
       "occasions he flattered himself he impressed every beholder with awe and\n",
       "admiration as vicegerent of the king; though the wits of Granada,\n",
       "particularly those who loitered about the palace of the captain-general,\n",
       "were apt to sneer at his petty parade, and, in allusion to the vagrant\n",
       "character of his subjects, to greet him with the appellation of “the\n",
       "king of the beggars.” One of the most fruitful sources of dispute\n",
       "between these two doughty rivals was the right claimed by the governor\n",
       "to have all things passed free of duty through the city that were\n",
       "intended for the use of himself or his garrison. By degrees this\n",
       "privilege had given rise to extensive smuggling. A nest of\n",
       "contrabandistas took up their abode in the hovels of the fortress and\n",
       "the numerous caves in its vicinity, and drove a thriving business under\n",
       "the connivance of the soldiers of the garrison.\n",
       "\n",
       "The vigilance of the captain-general was aroused. He consulted his legal\n",
       "adviser and factotum, a shrewd meddlesome escribano, or notary, who\n",
       "rejoiced in an opportunity of perplexing the old potentate of the\n",
       "Alhambra, and involving him in a maze of legal subtilties. He advised\n",
       "the captain-general to insist upon the right of examining every convoy\n",
       "passing through the gates of his city, and penned a long letter for him\n",
       "in vindication of the right. Governor Manco was a straight-forward\n",
       "cut-and-thrust old soldier, who hated an escribano worse than the devil,\n",
       "and this one in particular worse than all other escribanos.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What!” said he, curling up his moustaches fiercely, “does the\n",
       "captain-general set his man of the pen to practise confusions upon me?\n",
       "I’ll let him see an old soldier is not to be baffled by schoolcraft.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He seized his pen and scrawled a short letter in a crabbed hand, in\n",
       "which, without deigning to enter into argument, he insisted on the right\n",
       "of transit free of search, and denounced vengeance on any custom-house\n",
       "officer who should lay his unhallowed hand on any convoy protected by\n",
       "the flag of the Alhambra. While this question was agitated between the\n",
       "two pragmatical potentates, it so happened that a mule laden with\n",
       "supplies for the fortress arrived one day at the gate of Xenil, by which\n",
       "it was to traverse a suburb of the city on its way to the Alhambra. The\n",
       "convoy was headed by a testy old corporal, who had long served under the\n",
       "governor, and was a man after his own heart; as rusty and stanch as an\n",
       "old Toledo blade.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they approached the gate of the city, the corporal placed the banner\n",
       "of the Alhambra on the pack-saddle of the mule, and drawing himself up\n",
       "to a perfect perpendicular, advanced with his head dressed to the front,\n",
       "but with the wary side-glance of a cur passing through hostile ground\n",
       "and ready for a snap and a snarl.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Who goes there?” said the sentinel at the gate.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Soldier of the Alhambra!” said the corporal, without turning his head.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What have you in charge?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Provisions for the garrison.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Proceed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The corporal marched straight forward, followed by the convoy, but had\n",
       "not advanced many paces before a posse of custom-house officers rushed\n",
       "out of a small toll-house.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hallo there!” cried the leader. “Muleteer, halt, and open those\n",
       "packages.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The corporal wheeled round and drew himself up in battle-array. “Respect\n",
       "the flag of the Alhambra,” said he; “these things are for the governor.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“A figo for the governor and a figo for his flag. Muleteer, halt, I\n",
       "say.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Stop the convoy at your peril!” cried the corporal, cocking his musket.\n",
       "“Muleteer, proceed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The muleteer gave his beast a hearty thwack; the custom-house officer\n",
       "sprang forward and seized the halter; whereupon the corporal levelled\n",
       "his piece and shot him dead.\n",
       "\n",
       "The street was immediately in an uproar.\n",
       "\n",
       "The old corporal was seized, and after undergoing sundry kicks, and\n",
       "cuffs, and cudgellings, which are generally given impromptu by the mob\n",
       "in Spain as a foretaste of the after penalties of the law, he was loaded\n",
       "with irons and conducted to the city prison, while his comrades were\n",
       "permitted to proceed with the convoy, after it had been well rummaged,\n",
       "to the Alhambra.\n",
       "\n",
       "The old governor was in a towering passion when he heard of this insult\n",
       "to his flag and capture of his corporal. For a time he stormed about the\n",
       "Moorish halls, and vapored about the bastions, and looked down fire and\n",
       "sword upon the palace of the captain-general. Having vented the first\n",
       "ebullition of his wrath, he dispatched a message demanding the surrender\n",
       "of the corporal, as to him alone belonged the right of sitting in\n",
       "judgment on the offences of those under his command. The\n",
       "captain-general, aided by the pen of the delighted escribano, replied at\n",
       "great length, arguing, that, as the offence had been committed within\n",
       "the walls of his city, and against one of his civil officers, it was\n",
       "clearly within his proper jurisdiction. The governor rejoined by a\n",
       "repetition of his demand; the captain-general gave a sur-rejoinder of\n",
       "still greater length and legal acumen; the governor became hotter and\n",
       "more peremptory in his demands, and the captain-general cooler and more\n",
       "copious in his replies; until the old lion-hearted soldier absolutely\n",
       "roared with fury at being thus entangled in the meshes of legal\n",
       "controversy.\n",
       "\n",
       "While the subtle escribano was thus amusing himself at the expense of\n",
       "the governor, he was conducting the trial of the corporal, who, mewed up\n",
       "in a narrow dungeon of the prison, had merely a small grated window at\n",
       "which to show his iron-bound visage and receive the consolations of his\n",
       "friends.\n",
       "\n",
       "A mountain of written testimony was diligently heaped up, according to\n",
       "Spanish form, by the indefatigable escribano; the corporal was\n",
       "completely overwhelmed by it. He was convicted of murder and sentenced\n",
       "to be hanged.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was in vain the governor sent down remonstrance and menace from the\n",
       "Alhambra. The fatal day was at hand, and the corporal was put _in\n",
       "capilla_, that is to say, in the chapel of the prison, as is always done\n",
       "with culprits the day before execution, that they may meditate on their\n",
       "approaching end and repent them of their sins.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seeing things drawing to extremity, the old governor determined to\n",
       "attend to the affair in person. For this purpose he ordered out his\n",
       "carriage of state, and, surrounded by his guards, rumbled down the\n",
       "avenue of the Alhambra into the city. Driving to the house of the\n",
       "escribano, he summoned him to the portal.\n",
       "\n",
       "The eye of the old governor gleamed like a coal at beholding the\n",
       "smirking man of the law advancing with an air of exultation.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What is this I hear,” cried he, “that you are about to put to death one\n",
       "of my soldiers?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“All according to law--all in strict form of justice,” said the\n",
       "self-sufficient escribano, chuckling and rubbing his hands; “I can show\n",
       "your Excellency the written testimony in the case.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Fetch it hither,” said the governor. The escribano bustled into his\n",
       "office, delighted with having another opportunity of displaying his\n",
       "ingenuity at the expense of the hard-headed veteran.\n",
       "\n",
       "He returned with a satchel full of papers, and began to read a long\n",
       "deposition with professional volubility. By this time a crowd had\n",
       "collected, listening with out-stretched necks and gaping mouths.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Prithee, man, get into the carriage, out of this pestilent throng, that\n",

       "The escribano entered the carriage, when, in a twinkling, the door was\n",
       "closed, the coachman smacked his whip,--mules, carriage, guards, and all\n",
       "dashed off at a thundering rate, leaving the crowd in gaping wonderment;\n",
       "nor did the governor pause until he had lodged his prey in one of the\n",
       "strongest dungeons of the Alhambra.\n",
       "\n",
       "He then sent down a flag of truce in military style, proposing a cartel,\n",
       "or exchange of prisoners,--the corporal for the notary. The pride of the\n",
       "captain-general was piqued; he returned a contemptuous refusal, and\n",
       "forthwith caused a gallows, tall and strong, to be erected in the centre\n",
       "of the Plaza Nueva for the execution of the corporal.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oho! is that the game?” said Governor Manco. He gave orders, and\n",
       "immediately a gibbet was reared on the verge of the great beetling\n",
       "bastion that overlooked the Plaza. “Now,” said he, in a message to the\n",
       "captain-general, “hang my soldier when you please; but at the same time\n",
       "that he is swung off in the square, look up to see your escribano\n",
       "dangling against the sky.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The captain-general was inflexible; troops were paraded in the square;\n",
       "the drums beat, the bell tolled. An immense multitude of amateurs\n",
       "gathered together to behold the execution. On the other hand, the\n",
       "governor paraded his garrison on the bastion, and tolled the funeral\n",

       "took his seat in a large high-backed chair, assumed a bitter and\n",

       "soldier was brought in, still closely pinioned by his captors, and\n",
       "guarded by the corporal. He maintained, however, a resolute\n",
       "self-confident air, and returned the sharp, scrutinizing look of the\n",

       "\n",

       "Something too that concerns the security of this fortress, indeed of all\n",
       "Granada. But it is a matter to be imparted only to your private ear, or\n",
       "in presence of such only as are in your confidence.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The governor considered for a moment, and then directed the corporal and\n",
       "his men to withdraw, but to post themselves outside of the door, and be\n",
       "ready at a call. “This holy friar,” said he, “is my confessor, you may\n",
       "say anything in his presence;--and this damsel,” nodding towards the\n",
       "handmaid, who had loitered with an air of great curiosity, “this damsel\n",
       "is of great secrecy and discretion, and to be trusted with anything.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The soldier gave a glance between a squint and a leer at the demure\n",

       "remain.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When all the rest had withdrawn, the soldier commenced his story. He was\n",

       "apparent rank.\n",
       "\n",
       "“May it please your Excellency,” said he, “I am, as I before observed,\n",
       "a soldier, and have seen some hard service, but my term of enlistment\n",
       "being expired, I was discharged, not long since, from the army at\n",
       "Valladolid, and set out on foot for my native village in Andalusia.\n",

       "two or three hundred miles from this.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Even so,” replied the soldier, coolly. “I told your Excellency I had\n",

       "search of quarters for the night, but as far as my sight could reach\n",
       "there were no signs of habitation. I saw that I should have to make my\n",
       "bed on the naked plain, with my knapsack for a pillow; but your\n",
       "Excellency is an old soldier, and knows that to one who has been in the\n",
       "wars, such a night’s lodging is no great hardship.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The governor nodded assent, as he drew his pocket-handkerchief out of\n",
       "the basket-hilt to drive away a fly that buzzed about his nose.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, to make a long story short,” continued the soldier, “I trudged\n",
       "forward for several miles until I came to a bridge over a deep ravine,\n",
       "through which ran a little thread of water, almost dried up by the\n",
       "summer heat. At one end of the bridge was a Moorish tower, the upper end\n",
       "all in ruins, but a vault in the foundation quite entire. Here, thinks\n",
       "I, is a good place to make a halt; so I went down to the stream, and\n",
       "took a hearty drink, for the water was pure and sweet, and I was parched\n",
       "with thirst; then, opening my wallet, I took out an onion and a few\n",
       "crusts, which were all my provisions, and seating myself on a stone on\n",
       "the margin of the stream, began to make my supper,--intending afterwards\n",
       "to quarter myself for the night in the vault of the tower; and capital\n",
       "quarters they would have been for a campaigner just from the wars, as\n",
       "your Excellency, who is an old soldier, may suppose.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I have put up gladly with worse in my time,” said the governor,\n",
       "returning his pocket-handkerchief into the hilt of his sword.\n",
       "\n",
       "“While I was quietly crunching my crust,” pursued the soldier, “I heard\n",
       "something stir within the vault; I listened--it was the tramp of a\n",
       "horse. By-and-by a man came forth from a door in the foundation of the\n",
       "tower, close by the water’s edge, leading a powerful horse by the\n",
       "bridle. I could not well make out what he was, by the starlight. It had\n",
       "a suspicious look to be lurking among the ruins of a tower, in that wild\n",
       "solitary place. He might be a mere wayfarer, like myself; he might be a\n",
       "contrabandista; he might be a bandolero! what of that? thank heaven and\n",
       "my poverty, I had nothing to lose; so I sat still and crunched my crust.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He led his horse to the water, close by where I was sitting, so that I\n",
       "had a fair opportunity of reconnoitring him. To my surprise he was\n",
       "dressed in a Moorish garb, with a cuirass of steel, and a polished\n",
       "skull-cap that I distinguished by the reflection of the stars upon it.\n",
       "His horse, too, was harnessed in the Morisco fashion, with great shovel\n",
       "stirrups. He led him, as I said, to the side of the stream, into which\n",
       "the animal plunged his head almost to the eyes, and drank until I\n",
       "thought he would have burst.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Comrade,’ said I, ‘your steed drinks well; it’s a good sign when a\n",
       "horse plunges his muzzle bravely into the water.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘He may well drink,’ said the stranger, speaking with a Moorish\n",
       "accent; ‘it is a good year since he had his last draught.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘By Santiago,’ said I, ‘that beats even the camels I have seen in\n",
       "Africa. But come, you seem to be something of a soldier, will you sit\n",
       "down and take part of a soldier’s fare?’ In fact, I felt the want of a\n",
       "companion in this lonely place, and was willing to put up with an\n",
       "infidel. Besides, as your Excellency well knows, a soldier is never very\n",
       "particular about the faith of his company, and soldiers of all countries\n",
       "are comrades on peaceable ground.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The governor again nodded assent.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, as I was saying, I invited him to share my supper, such as it\n",
       "was, for I could not do less in common hospitality. ‘I have no time to\n",
       "pause for meat or drink,’ said he, ‘I have a long journey to make before\n",
       "morning.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘In what direction?’ said I.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Andalusia,’ said he.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Exactly my route,’ said I; ‘so, as you won’t stop and eat with me,\n",
       "perhaps you will let me mount and ride with you. I see your horse is of\n",
       "a powerful frame; I’ll warrant he’ll carry double.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Agreed,’ said the trooper; and it would not have been civil and\n",
       "soldierlike to refuse, especially as I had offered to share my supper\n",
       "with him. So up he mounted, and up I mounted behind him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Hold fast,’ said he, ‘my steed goes like the wind.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Never fear me,’ said I, and so off we set.\n",
       "\n",
       "“From a walk the horse soon passed to a trot, from a trot to a gallop,\n",
       "and from a gallop to a harum-scarum scamper. It seemed as if rocks,\n",
       "trees, houses, everything flew hurry-scurry behind us.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘What town is this?’ said I.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Segovia,’ said he; and before the word was out of his mouth, the\n",
       "towers of Segovia were out of sight. We swept up the Guadarrama\n",
       "mountains, and down by the Escurial; and we skirted the walls of\n",
       "Madrid, and we scoured away across the plains of La Mancha. In this way\n",
       "we went up hill and down dale, by towers and cities, all buried in deep\n",
       "sleep, and across mountains, and plains, and rivers, just glimmering in\n",
       "the starlight.\n",
       "\n",
       "“To make a long story short, and not to fatigue your Excellency, the\n",
       "trooper suddenly pulled up on the side of a mountain. ‘Here we are,’\n",
       "said he, ‘at the end of our journey.’ I looked about, but could see no\n",
       "signs of habitation, nothing but the mouth of a cavern. While I looked I\n",
       "saw multitudes of people in Moorish dresses, some on horseback, some on\n",
       "foot, arriving as if borne by the wind from all points of the compass,\n",
       "and hurrying into the mouth of the cavern like bees into a hive. Before\n",
       "I could ask a question, the trooper struck his long Moorish spurs into\n",
       "the horse’s flanks, and dashed in with the throng. We passed along a\n",
       "steep winding way, that descended into the very bowels of the mountain.\n",
       "As we pushed on, a light began to glimmer up, by little and little, like\n",
       "the first glimmerings of day, but what caused it I could not discern. It\n",
       "grew stronger and stronger, and enabled me to see everything around. I\n",
       "now noticed, as we passed along, great caverns, opening to the right and\n",
       "left, like halls in an arsenal. In some there were shields, and helmets,\n",
       "and cuirasses, and lances, and cimeters, hanging against the walls; in\n",
       "others there were great heaps of warlike munitions and camp-equipage\n",
       "lying upon the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It would have done your Excellency’s heart good, being an old soldier,\n",
       "to have seen such grand provision for war. Then, in other caverns, there\n",
       "were long rows of horsemen armed to the teeth, with lances raised and\n",
       "banners unfurled, all ready for the field; but they all sat motionless\n",
       "in their saddles, like so many statues. In other halls were warriors\n",
       "sleeping on the ground beside their horses, and foot-soldiers in groups\n",
       "ready to fall into the ranks. All were in old-fashioned Moorish dresses\n",
       "and armor.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Well, your Excellency, to cut a long story short, we at length entered\n",
       "an immense cavern, or I may say palace, of grotto-work, the walls of\n",
       "which seemed to be veined with gold and silver, and to sparkle with\n",
       "diamonds and sapphires and all kinds of precious stones. At the upper\n",
       "end sat a Moorish king on a golden throne, with his nobles on each side,\n",
       "and a guard of African blacks with drawn cimeters. All the crowd that\n",
       "continued to flock in, and amounted to thousands and thousands, passed\n",
       "one by one before his throne, each paying homage as he passed. Some of\n",
       "the multitude were dressed in magnificent robes, without stain or\n",
       "blemish, and sparkling with jewels; others in burnished and enamelled\n",
       "armor; while others were in mouldered and mildewed garments, and in\n",
       "armor all battered and dented and covered with rust.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I had hitherto held my tongue, for your Excellency well knows it is not\n",
       "for a soldier to ask many questions when on duty, but I could keep\n",
       "silent no longer.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Prithee, comrade,’ said I, ‘what is the meaning of all this?’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘This,’ said the trooper, ‘is a great and fearful mystery. Know, O\n",

       "last king of Granada.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘What is this you tell me?’ cried I, ‘Boabdil and his court were exiled\n",

       "for the king and army that marched forth from Granada at the time of the\n",
       "surrender, they were a mere phantom train of spirits and demons,\n",
       "permitted to assume those shapes to deceive the Christian sovereigns.\n",
       "And furthermore let me tell you, friend, that all Spain is a country\n",
       "under the power of enchantment. There is not a mountain cave, not a\n",
       "lonely watch-tower in the plains, nor ruined castle on the hills, but\n",
       "has some spell-bound warriors sleeping from age to age within its\n",
       "vaults, until the sins are expiated for which Allah permitted the\n",
       "dominion to pass for a time out of the hands of the faithful. Once every\n",
       "year, on the eve of St. John, they are released from enchantment, from\n",
       "sunset to sunrise, and permitted to repair here to pay homage to their\n",
       "sovereign! and the crowds which you beheld swarming into the cavern are\n",
       "Moslem warriors from their haunts in all parts of Spain. For my own\n",
       "part, you saw the ruined tower of the bridge in Old Castile, where I\n",
       "have now wintered and summered for many hundred years, and where I must\n",
       "be back again by daybreak. As to the battalions of horse and foot which\n",
       "you beheld drawn up in array in the neighboring caverns, they are the\n",
       "spell-bound warriors of Granada. It is written in the book of fate, that\n",
       "when the enchantment is broken, Boabdil will descend from the mountain\n",
       "at the head of this army, resume his throne in the Alhambra and his sway\n",
       "of Granada, and gathering together the enchanted warriors from all parts\n",
       "of Spain, will reconquer the Peninsula and restore it to Moslem rule.’\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘And when shall this happen?’ said I.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Allah alone knows: we had hoped the day of deliverance was at hand;\n",
       "but there reigns at present a vigilant governor in the Alhambra, a\n",
       "stanch old soldier, well known as Governor Manco. While such a warrior\n",
       "holds command of the very outpost, and stands ready to check the first\n",
       "irruption from the mountain, I fear Boabdil and his soldiery must be\n",
       "content to rest upon their arms.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Here the governor raised himself somewhat perpendicularly, adjusted his\n",
       "sword, and twirled up his moustaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "“To make a long story short, and not to fatigue your Excellency, the\n",
       "trooper, having given me this account, dismounted from his steed.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘Tarry here,’ said he, ‘and guard my steed while I go and bow the knee\n",
       "to Boabdil.’ So saying, he strode away among the throng that pressed\n",
       "forward to the throne.\n",
       "\n",
       "“‘What’s to be done?’ thought I, when thus left to myself; ‘shall I wait\n",
       "here until this infidel returns to whisk me off on his goblin steed, the\n",
       "Lord knows where; or shall I make the most of my time and beat a retreat\n",
       "from this hobgoblin community?’ A soldier’s mind is soon made up, as\n",
       "your Excellency well knows. As to the horse, he belonged to an avowed\n",
       "enemy of the faith and the realm, and was a fair prize according to the\n",
       "rules of war. So hoisting myself from the crupper into the saddle, I\n",
       "turned the reins, struck the Moorish stirrups into the sides of the\n",
       "steed, and put him to make the best of his way out of the passage by\n",
       "which he had entered. As we scoured by the halls where the Moslem\n",
       "horsemen sat in motionless battalions, I thought I heard the clang of\n",
       "armor and a hollow murmur of voices. I gave the steed another taste of\n",
       "the stirrups and doubled my speed. There was now a sound behind me like\n",
       "a rushing blast; I heard the clatter of a thousand hoofs; a countless\n",
       "throng overtook me. I was borne along in the press, and hurled forth\n",
       "from the mouth of the cavern, while thousands of shadowy forms were\n",
       "swept off in every direction by the four winds of heaven.\n",
       "\n",
       "“In the whirl and confusion of the scene I was thrown senseless to the\n",
       "earth. When I came to myself, I was lying on the brow of a hill, with\n",
       "the Arabian steed standing beside me; for in falling, my arm had slipped\n",
       "within the bridle, which, I presume, prevented his whisking off to Old\n",
       "Castile.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Your Excellency may easily judge of my surprise, on looking round, to\n",
       "behold hedges of aloes and Indian figs and other proofs of a southern\n",
       "climate, and to see a great city below me, with towers, and palaces, and\n",
       "a grand cathedral.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I descended the hill cautiously, leading my steed, for I was afraid to\n",
       "mount him again, lest he should play me some slippery trick. As I\n",
       "descended I met with your patrol, who let me into the secret that it was\n",
       "Granada that lay before me, and that I was actually under the walls of\n",
       "the Alhambra, the fortress of the redoubted Governor Manco, the terror\n",
       "of all enchanted Moslems. When I heard this, I determined at once to\n",
       "seek your Excellency, to inform you of all that I had seen, and to warn\n",
       "you of the perils that surround and undermine you, that you may take\n",
       "measures in time to guard your fortress, and the kingdom itself, from\n",
       "this intestine army that lurks in the very bowels of the land.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And prithee, friend, you who are a veteran campaigner, and have seen so\n",
       "much service,” said the governor, “how would you advise me to proceed,\n",
       "in order to prevent this evil?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It is not for a humble private of the ranks,” said the soldier,\n",
       "modestly, “to pretend to instruct a commander of your Excellency’s\n",
       "sagacity, but it appears to me that your Excellency might cause all the\n",
       "caves and entrances into the mountains to be walled up with solid\n",
       "mason-work, so that Boabdil and his army might be completely corked up\n",
       "in their subterranean habitation. If the good father, too,” added the\n",
       "soldier, reverently bowing to the friar, and devoutly crossing himself,\n",
       "“would consecrate the barricadoes with his blessing, and put up a few\n",
       "crosses and relics and images of saints, I think they might withstand\n",
       "all the power of infidel enchantments.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“They doubtless would be of great avail,” said the friar.\n",
       "\n",
       "The governor now placed his arm akimbo, with his hand resting on the\n",
       "hilt of his toledo, fixed his eye upon the soldier, and gently wagging\n",
       "his head from one side to the other,--\n",
       "\n",
       "“So, friend,” said he, “then you really suppose I am to be gulled with\n",
       "this cock-and-bull story about enchanted mountains and enchanted Moors?\n",
       "Hark ye, culprit!--not another word. An old soldier you may be, but\n",
       "you’ll find you have an older soldier to deal with, and one not easily\n",
       "outgeneralled. Ho! guards there! put this fellow in irons.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The demure handmaid would have put in a word in favor of the prisoner,\n",
       "but the governor silenced her with a look.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they were pinioning the soldier, one of the guards felt something of\n",
       "bulk in his pocket, and drawing it forth, found a long leathern purse\n",
       "that appeared to be well filled. Holding it by one corner, he turned out\n",
       "the contents upon the table before the governor, and never did\n",
       "freebooter’s bag make more gorgeous delivery. Out tumbled rings, and\n",
       "jewels, and rosaries of pearls, and sparkling diamond crosses, and a\n",
       "profusion of ancient golden coin, some of which fell jingling to the\n",
       "floor, and rolled away to the uttermost parts of the chamber.\n",
       "\n",
       "For a time the functions of justice were suspended; there was a\n",
       "universal scramble after the glittering fugitives. The governor alone,\n",
       "who was imbued with true Spanish pride, maintained his stately decorum,\n",
       "though his eye betrayed a little anxiety until the last coin and jewel\n",
       "was restored to the sack.\n",
       "\n",
       "The friar was not so calm; his whole face glowed like a furnace, and\n",
       "his eyes twinkled and flashed at sight of the rosaries and crosses.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sacrilegious wretch that thou art!” exclaimed he; “what church or\n",
       "sanctuary hast thou been plundering of these sacred relics?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Neither one nor the other, holy father. If they be sacrilegious spoils,\n",
       "they must have been taken, in times long past, by the infidel trooper I\n",
       "have mentioned. I was just going to tell his Excellency when he\n",
       "interrupted me, that, on taking possession of the trooper’s horse, I\n",
       "unhooked a leathern sack which hung at the saddle-bow, and which I\n",
       "presume contained the plunder of his campaignings in days of old, when\n",
       "the Moors overran the country.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Mighty well; at present you will make up your mind to take up your\n",
       "quarters in a chamber of the Vermilion Tower, which, though not under a\n",
       "magic spell, will hold you as safe as any cave of your enchanted Moors.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Your Excellency will do as you think proper,” said the prisoner,\n",
       "coolly. “I shall be thankful to your Excellency for any accommodation in\n",
       "the fortress. A soldier who has been in the wars, as your Excellency\n",
       "well knows, is not particular about his lodgings. Provided I have a snug\n",
       "dungeon and regular rations, I shall manage to make myself comfortable.\n",
       "I would only entreat that while your Excellency is so careful about me,\n",
       "you would have an eye to your fortress, and think on the hint I dropped\n",
       "about stopping up the entrances to the mountain.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Here ended the scene. The prisoner was conducted to a strong dungeon in\n",
       "the Vermilion Tower, the Arabian steed was led to his Excellency’s\n",
       "stable, and the trooper’s sack was deposited in his Excellency’s strong\n",
       "box. To the latter, it is true, the friar made some demur, questioning\n",
       "whether the sacred relics, which were evidently sacrilegious spoils,\n",
       "should not be placed in custody of the church; but as the governor was\n",
       "peremptory on the subject, and was absolute lord in the Alhambra, the\n",
       "friar discreetly dropped the discussion, but determined to convey\n",
       "intelligence of the fact to the church dignitaries in Granada.\n",
       "\n",
       "To explain these prompt and rigid measures on the part of old Governor\n",
       "Manco, it is proper to observe, that about this time the Alpuxarra\n",
       "mountains in the neighborhood of Granada were terribly infested by a\n",
       "gang of robbers, under the command of a daring chief named Manuel\n",
       "Borasco, who were accustomed to prowl about the country, and even to\n",
       "enter the city in various disguises, to gain intelligence of the\n",
       "departure of convoys of merchandise, or travellers with well-lined\n",
       "purses, whom they took care to waylay in distant and solitary passes of\n",
       "the road. These repeated and daring outrages had awakened the attention\n",
       "of government, and the commanders of the various posts had received\n",
       "instructions to be on the alert, and to take up all suspicious\n",
       "stragglers. Governor Manco was particularly zealous in consequence of\n",
       "the various stigmas that had been cast upon his fortress, and he now\n",
       "doubted not he had entrapped some formidable desperado of this gang.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the mean time the story took wind, and became the talk, not merely of\n",
       "the fortress, but of the whole city of Granada. It was said that the\n",
       "noted robber Manuel Borasco, the terror of the Alpuxarras, had fallen\n",
       "into the clutches of old Governor Manco, and been cooped up by him in a\n",
       "dungeon of the Vermilion Towers; and every one who had been robbed by\n",
       "him flocked to recognize the marauder. The Vermilion Towers, as is well\n",
       "known, stand apart from the Alhambra on a sister hill, separated from\n",
       "the main fortress by the ravine down which passes the main avenue. There\n",
       "were no outer walls, but a sentinel patrolled before the tower. The\n",
       "window of the chamber in which the soldier was confined was strongly\n",
       "grated, and looked upon a small esplanade. Here the good folks of\n",
       "Granada repaired to gaze at him, as they would at a laughing hyena,\n",
       "grinning through the cage of a menagerie. Nobody, however, recognized\n",
       "him for Manuel Borasco, for that terrible robber was noted for a\n",
       "ferocious physiognomy, and had by no means the good-humored squint of\n",
       "the prisoner. Visitors came not merely from the city, but from all parts\n",
       "of the country; but nobody knew him, and there began to be doubts in the\n",
       "minds of the common people whether there might not be some truth in his\n",
       "story. That Boabdil and his army were shut up in the mountain, was an\n",
       "old tradition which many of the ancient inhabitants had heard from their\n",
       "fathers. Numbers went up to the Mountain of the Sun, or rather of St.\n",
       "Elena, in search of the cave mentioned by the soldier; and saw and\n",
       "peeped into the deep dark pit, descending, no one knows how far, into\n",
       "the mountain, and which remains there to this day--the fabled entrance\n",
       "to the subterranean abode of Boabdil.\n",
       "\n",
       "By degrees the soldier became popular with the common people. A\n",
       "freebooter of the mountains is by no means the opprobrious character in\n",
       "Spain that a robber is in any other country: on the contrary, he is a\n",
       "kind of chivalrous personage in the eyes of the lower classes. There is\n",
       "always a disposition, also, to cavil at the conduct of those in command;\n",
       "and many began to murmur at the high-handed measures of old Governor\n",
       "Manco, and to look upon the prisoner in the light of a martyr.\n",
       "\n",
       "The soldier, moreover, was a merry, waggish fellow, that had a joke for\n",
       "every one who came near his window, and a soft speech for every female.\n",
       "He had procured an old guitar also, and would sit by his window and sing\n",
       "ballads and love-ditties to the delight of the women of the\n",
       "neighborhood, who would assemble on the esplanade in the evening and\n",
       "dance boleros to his music. Having trimmed off his rough beard, his\n",
       "sunburnt face found favor in the eyes of the fair, and the demure\n",
       "handmaid of the governor declared that his squint was perfectly\n",
       "irresistible. This kind-hearted damsel had from the first evinced a deep\n",
       "sympathy in his fortunes, and having in vain tried to mollify the\n",
       "governor, had set to work privately to mitigate the rigor of his\n",
       "dispensations. Every day she brought the prisoner some crumbs of comfort\n",
       "which had fallen from the governor’s table, or been abstracted from his\n",
       "larder, together with, now and then, a consoling bottle of choice Val de\n",
       "Peñas, or rich Malaga.\n",
       "\n",
       "While this petty treason was going on in the very centre of the old\n",
       "governor’s citadel, a storm of open war was brewing up among his\n",
       "external foes. The circumstance of a bag of gold and jewels having been\n",
       "found upon the person of the supposed robber, had been reported, with\n",
       "many exaggerations, in Granada. A question of territorial jurisdiction\n",
       "was immediately started by the governor’s inveterate rival, the\n",
       "captain-general. He insisted that the prisoner had been captured without\n",
       "the precincts of the Alhambra, and within the rules of his authority. He\n",
       "demanded his body therefore, and the _spolia opima_ taken with him. Due\n",
       "information having been carried likewise by the friar to the grand\n",
       "inquisitor of the crosses and rosaries, and other relics contained in\n",
       "the bag, he claimed the culprit as having been guilty of sacrilege, and\n",
       "insisted that his plunder was due to the church, and his body to the\n",
       "next _auto-da-fe_. The feuds ran high; the governor was furious, and\n",
       "swore, rather than surrender his captive, he would hang him up within\n",
       "the Alhambra, as a spy caught within the purlieus of the fortress.\n",
       "\n",
       "The captain-general threatened to send a body of soldiers to transfer\n",
       "the prisoner from the Vermilion Tower to the city. The grand inquisitor\n",
       "was equally bent upon dispatching a number of the familiars of the Holy\n",
       "Office. Word was brought late at night to the governor of these\n",
       "machinations. “Let them come,” said he, “they’ll find me beforehand with\n",
       "them; he must rise bright and early who would take in an old soldier.”\n",
       "He accordingly issued orders to have the prisoner removed at daybreak,\n",
       "to the donjon-keep within the walls of the Alhambra. “And d’ye hear,\n",
       "child,” said he to his demure handmaid, “tap at my door, and wake me\n",
       "before cock-crowing, that I may see to the matter myself.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The day dawned, the cock crowed, but nobody tapped at the door of the\n",
       "governor. The sun rose high above the mountain-tops, and glittered in at\n",
       "his casement, ere the governor was awakened from his morning dreams by\n",
       "his veteran corporal, who stood before him with terror stamped upon his\n",
       "iron visage.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He’s off! he’s gone!” cried the corporal, gasping for breath.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Who’s off--who’s gone?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“The soldier--the robber--the devil, for aught I know; his dungeon is\n",
       "empty, but the door locked: no one knows how he has escaped out of it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Who saw him last?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Your handmaid; she brought him his supper.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Let her be called instantly.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Here was new matter of confusion. The chamber of the demure damsel was\n",
       "likewise empty, her bed had not been slept in: she had doubtless gone\n",
       "off with the culprit, as she had appeared, for some days past, to have\n",
       "frequent conversations with him.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was wounding the old governor in a tender part, but he had scarce\n",
       "time to wince at it, when new misfortunes broke upon his view. On going\n",
       "into his cabinet he found his strong box open, the leather purse of the\n",
       "trooper abstracted and with it a couple of corpulent bags of doubloons.\n",
       "\n",
       "But how, and which way had the fugitives escaped? An old peasant who\n",
       "lived in a cottage by the road-side leading up into the Sierra, declared\n",
       "that he had heard the tramp of a powerful steed just before daybreak,\n",
       "passing up into the mountains. He had looked out at his casement, and\n",
       "could just distinguish a horseman, with a female seated before him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Search the stables!” cried Governor Manco. The stables were searched;\n",
       "all the horses were in their stalls, excepting the Arabian steed. In his\n",
       "place was a stout cudgel, tied to the manger, and on it a label bearing\n",
       "these words, “A gift to Governor Manco, from an Old Soldier.”\n",

       "A FÊTE IN THE ALHAMBRA\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The Saint’s day of my neighbor and rival potentate, the count, took\n",
       "place during his sojourn in the Alhambra, on which occasion he gave a\n",
       "domestic fête; assembling round him the members of his family and\n",
       "household, while the stewards and old servants from his distant\n",
       "possessions came to pay him reverence and partake of the good cheer\n",
       "which was sure to be provided. It presented a type, though doubtless a\n",
       "faint one, of the establishment of a Spanish noble in the olden time.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Spaniards were always grandiose in their notions of style. Huge\n",
       "palaces; lumbering equipages, laden with footmen and lackeys; pompous\n",
       "retinues, and useless dependents of all kinds; the dignity of a noble\n",
       "seemed commensurate with the legions who loitered about his halls, fed\n",
       "at his expense, and seemed ready to devour him alive. This, doubtless,\n",
       "originated in the necessity of keeping up hosts of armed retainers\n",
       "during the wars with the Moors; wars of inroads and surprises; when a\n",
       "noble was liable to be suddenly assailed in his castle by a foray of the\n",
       "enemy, or summoned to the field by his sovereign.\n",
       "\n",
       "The custom remained after the wars were at an end; and what originated\n",
       "in necessity was kept up through ostentation. The wealth which flowed\n",
       "into the country from conquests and discoveries fostered the passion for\n",
       "princely establishments. According to magnificent old Spanish usage, in\n",
       "which pride and generosity bore equal parts, a superannuated servant was\n",
       "never turned off, but became a charge for the rest of his days; nay, his\n",
       "children, and his children’s children, and often their relatives to the\n",
       "right and left, became gradually entailed upon the family. Hence the\n",
       "huge palaces of the Spanish nobility, which have such an air of empty\n",
       "ostentation from the greatness of their size compared with the\n",
       "mediocrity and scantiness of their furniture, were absolutely required,\n",
       "in the golden days of Spain, by the patriarchal habits of their\n",
       "possessors. They were little better than vast barracks for their\n",
       "hereditary generations of hangers-on that battened at the expense of a\n",
       "Spanish noble.\n",
       "\n",
       "These patriarchal habits of the Spanish nobility have declined with\n",
       "their revenues; though the spirit which prompted them remains, and wars\n",
       "sadly with their altered fortunes. The poorest among them have always\n",
       "some hereditary hangers-on, who live at their expense, and make them\n",
       "poorer. Some who, like my neighbor the count, retain a modicum of their\n",
       "once princely possessions, keep up a shadow of the ancient system, and\n",
       "their estates are overrun and the produce consumed by generations of\n",
       "idle retainers.\n",
       "\n",
       "The count held estates in various parts of the kingdom, some including\n",
       "whole villages; yet the revenues collected from them were comparatively\n",
       "small; some of them, he assured me, barely fed the hordes of dependents\n",
       "nestled upon them, who seemed to consider themselves entitled to live\n",
       "rent-free and be maintained into the bargain, because their forefathers\n",
       "had been so since time immemorial.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Saint’s day of the old count gave me a glimpse into a Spanish\n",
       "interior. For two or three days previous preparations were made for the\n",
       "fête. Viands of all kinds were brought up from town, greeting the\n",
       "olfactory nerves of the old invalid guards, as they were borne past them\n",
       "through the Gate of Justice. Servants hurried officiously about the\n",
       "courts; the ancient kitchen of the palace was again alive with the tread\n",
       "of cooks and scullions, and blazed with unwonted fires.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the day arrived I beheld the old count in patriarchal state, his\n",
       "family and household around him, with functionaries who mismanaged his\n",
       "estates at a distance and consumed the proceeds; while numerous old\n",
       "worn-out servants and pensioners were loitering about the courts and\n",
       "keeping within smell of the kitchen.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a joyous day in the Alhambra. The guests dispersed themselves\n",
       "about the palace before the hour of dinner, enjoying the luxuries of its\n",
       "courts and fountains, and embosomed gardens, and music and laughter\n",
       "resounded through its late silent halls.\n",
       "\n",
       "The feast, for a set dinner in Spain is literally a feast, was served in\n",
       "the beautiful Morisco Hall of “Las dos Hermanas.” The table was loaded\n",
       "with all the luxuries of the season: there was an almost interminable\n",
       "succession of dishes; showing how truly the feast at the rich Camachos’\n",
       "wedding in “Don Quixote” was a picture of a Spanish banquet. A joyous\n",
       "conviviality prevailed round the board; for though Spaniards are\n",
       "generally abstemious, they are complete revellers on occasions like the\n",
       "present, and none more so than the Andalusians. For my part, there was\n",
       "something peculiarly exciting in thus sitting at a feast in the royal\n",
       "halls of the Alhambra, given by one who might claim remote affinity with\n",
       "its Moorish kings, and who was a lineal representative of Gonsalvo of\n",
       "Cordova, one of the most distinguished of the Christian conquerors.\n",
       "\n",
       "The banquet ended, the company adjourned to the Hall of Ambassadors.\n",
       "Here every one endeavored to contribute to the general amusement,\n",
       "singing, improvising, telling wonderful tales, or dancing popular dances\n",
       "to that all-pervading talisman of Spanish pleasure, the guitar.\n",
       "\n",
       "The count’s gifted little daughter was as usual the life and delight of\n",
       "the assemblage, and I was more than ever struck with her aptness and\n",
       "wonderful versatility. She took a part in two or three scenes of elegant\n",
       "comedy with some of her companions, and performed them with exquisite\n",
       "point and finished grace; she gave imitations of the popular Italian\n",
       "singers, some serious, some comic, with a rare quality of voice, and, I\n",
       "was assured, with singular fidelity; she imitated the dialects, dances,\n",
       "ballads, and movements and manners of the gypsies and the peasants of\n",
       "the Vega with equal felicity; but everything was done with an\n",
       "all-pervading grace and a ladylike tact perfectly fascinating.\n",
       "\n",
       "The great charm of everything she did was its freedom from pretension or\n",
       "ambitious display, its happy spontaneity. Everything sprang from the\n",
       "impulse of the moment; or was in prompt compliance with a request. She\n",
       "seemed unconscious of the rarity and extent of her own talent, and was\n",
       "like a child at home revelling in the buoyancy of its own gay and\n",
       "innocent spirits. Indeed, I was told she had never exerted her talents\n",
       "in general society, but only, as at present, in the domestic circle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her faculty of observation and her perception of character must have\n",
       "been remarkably quick, for she could have had only casual and transient\n",
       "glances at the scenes, manners, and customs depicted with such truth and\n",
       "spirit. “Indeed it is a continual wonder to us,” said the countess,\n",
       "“where the child [la Niña] has picked up these things, her life being\n",
       "passed almost entirely at home, in the bosom of the family.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Evening approached; twilight began to throw its shadows about the halls,\n",
       "and the bats to steal forth from their lurking-place and flit about. A\n",
       "notion seized the little damsel and some of her youthful companions, to\n",
       "set out, under the guidance of Dolores, and explore the less frequented\n",
       "parts of the palace in quest of mysteries and enchantments. Thus\n",
       "conducted, they peeped fearfully into the gloomy old mosque, but quick\n",
       "drew back on being told that a Moorish king had been murdered there;\n",
       "they ventured into the mysterious regions of the bath, frightening\n",
       "themselves with the sounds and murmurs of hidden aqueducts, and flying\n",
       "with mock panic at the alarm of phantom Moors. They then undertook the\n",
       "adventure of the Iron Gate, a place of baleful note in the Alhambra. It\n",
       "is a postern gate, opening into a dark ravine; a narrow covered way\n",
       "leads down to it, which used to be the terror of Dolores and her\n",
       "playmates in childhood, as it was said a hand without a body would\n",
       "sometimes be stretched out from the wall and seize hold of the\n",
       "passers-by.\n",
       "\n",
       "The little party of enchantment-hunters ventured to the entrance of the\n",
       "covered way, but nothing would tempt them to enter, in this hour of\n",
       "gathering gloom; they dreaded the grasp of the phantom arm.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length they came running back into the Hall of Ambassadors in a mock\n",
       "paroxysm of terror: they had positively seen two spectral figures all in\n",
       "white. They had not stopped to examine them; but could not be mistaken,\n",
       "for they glared distinctly through the surrounding gloom. Dolores soon\n",
       "arrived and explained the mystery. The spectres proved to be two statues\n",
       "of nymphs in white marble, placed at the entrance of a vaulted passage.\n",
       "Upon this a grave, but, as I thought, somewhat sly old gentleman\n",
       "present, who, I believe, was the count’s advocate or legal adviser,\n",
       "assured them that these statues were connected with one of the greatest\n",
       "mysteries of the Alhambra; that there was a curious history concerning\n",
       "them, and, moreover, that they stood a living monument in marble of\n",
       "female secrecy and discretion. All present entreated him to tell the\n",
       "history of the statues. He took a little time to recollect the details,\n",
       "and then gave them in substance the following legend:\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "LEGEND OF THE TWO DISCREET STATUES\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "There lived once in a waste apartment of the Alhambra a merry little\n",
       "fellow, named Lope Sanchez, who worked in the gardens, and was as brisk\n",
       "and blithe as a grasshopper, singing all day long. He was the life and\n",
       "soul of the fortress; when his work was over, he would sit on one of the\n",
       "stone benches of the esplanade, strum his guitar, and sing long ditties\n",
       "about the Cid, and Bernardo del Carpio, and Fernando del Pulgar, and\n",
       "other Spanish heroes, for the amusement of the old soldiers of the\n",
       "fortress; or would strike up a merrier tune, and set the girls dancing\n",
       "boleros and fandangos.\n",
       "\n",
       "Like most little men, Lope Sanchez had a strapping buxom dame for a\n",
       "wife, who could almost have put him in her pocket; but he lacked the\n",
       "usual poor man’s lot--instead of ten children he had but one. This was\n",
       "a little black-eyed girl about twelve years of age, named Sanchica, who\n",
       "was as merry as himself, and the delight of his heart. She played about\n",
       "him as he worked in the gardens, danced to his guitar as he sat in the\n",
       "shade, and ran as wild as a young fawn about the groves and alleys and\n",
       "ruined halls of the Alhambra.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was now the eve of the blessed St. John, and the holiday-loving\n",
       "gossips of the Alhambra, men, women, and children, went up at night to\n",
       "the Mountain of the Sun, which rises above the Generalife, to keep their\n",
       "midsummer vigil on its level summit. It was a bright moonlight night,\n",
       "and all the mountains were gray and silvery, and the city, with its\n",
       "domes and spires, lay in shadows below, and the Vega was like a fairy\n",
       "land, with haunted streams gleaming among its dusky groves. On the\n",
       "highest part of the mountain they lit up a bonfire, according to an old\n",
       "custom of the country handed down from the Moors. The inhabitants of the\n",
       "surrounding country were keeping a similar vigil, and bonfires, here and\n",
       "there in the Vega, and along the folds of the mountains, blazed up\n",
       "palely in the moonlight.\n",
       "\n",
       "The evening was gayly passed in dancing to the guitar of Lope Sanchez,\n",
       "who was never so joyous as when on a holiday revel of the kind. While\n",
       "the dance was going on, the little Sanchica with some of her playmates\n",
       "sported among the ruins of an old Moorish fort that crowns the mountain,\n",
       "when, in gathering pebbles in the fosse, she found a small hand\n",
       "curiously carved of jet, the fingers closed, and the thumb firmly\n",
       "clasped upon them. Overjoyed with her good fortune, she ran to her\n",
       "mother with her prize. It immediately became a subject of sage\n",
       "speculation, and was eyed by some with superstitious distrust. “Throw it\n",
       "away,” said one; “it’s Moorish,--depend upon it, there’s mischief and\n",
       "witchcraft in it.” “By no means,” said another; “you may sell it for\n",
       "something to the jewellers of the Zacatin.” In the midst of this\n",
       "discussion an old tawny soldier drew near, who had served in Africa, and\n",
       "was as swarthy as a Moor. He examined the hand with a knowing look. “I\n",
       "have seen things of this kind,” said he, “among the Moors of Barbary. It\n",
       "is a great virtue to guard against the evil eye, and all kinds of spells\n",
       "and enchantments. I give you joy, friend Lope, this bodes good luck to\n",
       "your child.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon hearing this, the wife of Lope Sanchez tied the little hand of jet\n",
       "to a ribbon, and hung it round the neck of her daughter.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sight of this talisman called up all the favorite superstitions\n",
       "about the Moors. The dance was neglected, and they sat in groups on the\n",
       "ground, telling old legendary tales handed down from their ancestors.\n",
       "Some of their stories turned upon the wonders of the very mountain upon\n",
       "which they were seated, which is a famous hobgoblin region. One ancient\n",
       "crone gave a long account of the subterranean palace in the bowels of\n",
       "that mountain where Boabdil and all his Moslem court are said to remain\n",
       "enchanted. “Among yonder ruins,” said she, pointing to some crumbling\n",
       "walls and mounds of earth on a distant part of the mountain, “there is a\n",
       "deep black pit that goes down, down into the very heart of the mountain.\n",
       "For all the money in Granada I would not look down into it. Once upon a\n",
       "time a poor man of the Alhambra, who tended goats upon this mountain,\n",
       "scrambled down into that pit after a kid that had fallen in. He came out\n",
       "again all wild and staring, and told such things of what he had seen,\n",
       "that every one thought his brain was turned. He raved for a day or two\n",
       "about the hobgoblin Moors that had pursued him in the cavern, and could\n",
       "hardly be persuaded to drive his goats up again to the mountain. He did\n",
       "so at last, but, poor man, he never came down again. The neighbors found\n",
       "his goats browsing about the Moorish ruins, and his hat and mantle\n",
       "lying near the mouth of the pit, but he was never more heard of.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The little Sanchica listened with breathless attention to this story.\n",
       "She was of a curious nature, and felt immediately a great hankering to\n",
       "peep into this dangerous pit. Stealing away from her companions, she\n",
       "sought the distant ruins, and, after groping for some time among them,\n",
       "came to a small hollow, or basin, near the brow of the mountain, where\n",
       "it swept steeply down into the valley of the Darro. In the centre of\n",
       "this basin yawned the mouth of the pit. Sanchica ventured to the verge,\n",
       "and peeped in. All was as black as pitch, and gave an idea of\n",
       "immeasurable depth. Her blood ran cold; she drew back, then peeped in\n",
       "again, then would have run away, then took another peep,--the very\n",
       "horror of the thing was delightful to her. At length she rolled a large\n",
       "stone, and pushed it over the brink. For some time it fell in silence;\n",
       "then struck some rocky projection with a violent crash; then rebounded\n",
       "from side to side, rumbling and tumbling, with a noise like thunder;\n",
       "then made a final splash into water, far, far below,--and all was again\n",
       "silent.\n",
       "\n",
       "The silence, however, did not long continue. It seemed as if something\n",
       "had been awakened within this dreary abyss. A murmuring sound gradually\n",
       "rose out of the pit like the hum and buzz of a beehive. It grew louder\n",
       "and louder; there was the confusion of voices as of a distant multitude,\n",
       "together with the faint din of arms, clash of cymbals and clangor of\n",
       "trumpets, as if some army were marshalling for battle in the very bowels\n",
       "of the mountain.\n",
       "\n",
       "The child drew off with silent awe, and hastened back to the place where\n",
       "she had left her parents and their companions. All were gone. The\n",
       "bonfire was expiring, and its last wreath of smoke curling up in the\n",
       "moonshine. The distant fires that had blazed along the mountains and in\n",
       "the Vega were all extinguished, and everything seemed to have sunk to\n",
       "repose. Sanchica called her parents and some of her companions by name,\n",
       "but received no reply. She ran down the side of the mountain, and by the\n",
       "gardens of the Generalife, until she arrived in the alley of trees\n",
       "leading to the Alhambra, when she seated herself on a bench of a woody\n",
       "recess, to recover breath. The bell from the watch-tower of the Alhambra\n",
       "tolled midnight. There was a deep tranquillity as if all nature slept;\n",
       "excepting the low tinkling sound of an unseen stream that ran under the\n",
       "covert of the bushes. The breathing sweetness of the atmosphere was\n",
       "lulling her to sleep, when her eye was caught by something glittering at\n",
       "a distance, and to her surprise she beheld a long cavalcade of Moorish\n",
       "warriors pouring down the mountain-side and along the leafy avenues.\n",
       "Some were armed with lances and shields; others, with cimeters and\n",
       "battle-axes, and with polished cuirasses that flashed in the moonbeams.\n",
       "Their horses pranced proudly and champed upon their bits, but their\n",
       "tramp caused no more sound than if they had been shod with felt, and the\n",
       "riders were all as pale as death. Among them rode a beautiful lady, with\n",
       "a crowned head and long golden locks entwined with pearls. The housings\n",
       "of her palfrey were of crimson velvet embroidered with gold, and swept\n",
       "the earth; but she rode all disconsolate, with eyes ever fixed upon the\n",
       "ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then succeeded a train of courtiers magnificently arrayed in robes and\n",
       "turbans of divers colors, and amidst them, on a cream-colored charger,\n",
       "rode King Boabdil el Chico, in a royal mantle covered with jewels, and a\n",
       "crown sparkling with diamonds. The little Sanchica knew him by his\n",
       "yellow beard, and his resemblance to his portrait, which she had often\n",
       "seen in the picture-gallery of the Generalife. She gazed in wonder and\n",
       "admiration at this royal pageant, as it passed glistening among the\n",
       "trees; but though she knew these monarchs and courtiers and warriors, so\n",
       "pale and silent, were out of the common course of nature, and things of\n",
       "magic and enchantment, yet she looked on with a bold heart, such courage\n",
       "did she derive from the mystic talisman of the hand, which was suspended\n",
       "about her neck.\n",
       "\n",
       "The cavalcade having passed by, she rose and followed. It continued on\n",
       "to the great Gate of Justice, which stood wide open; the old invalid\n",
       "sentinels on duty lay on the stone benches of the barbican, buried in\n",
       "profound and apparently charmed sleep, and the phantom pageant swept\n",
       "noiselessly by them with flaunting banner and triumphant state. Sanchica\n",
       "would have followed; but to her surprise she beheld an opening in the\n",
       "earth, within the barbican, leading down beneath the foundations of the\n",
       "tower. She entered for a little distance, and was encouraged to proceed\n",
       "by finding steps rudely hewn in the rock, and a vaulted passage here and\n",
       "there lit up by a silver lamp, which, while it gave light, diffused\n",
       "likewise a grateful fragrance. Venturing on, she came at last to a great\n",
       "hall, wrought out of the heart of the mountain, magnificently furnished\n",
       "in the Moorish style, and lighted up by silver and crystal lamps. Here,\n",
       "on an ottoman, sat an old man in Moorish dress, with a long white beard,\n",
       "nodding and dozing, with a staff in his hand, which seemed ever to be\n",
       "slipping from his grasp; while at a little distance sat a beautiful\n",
       "lady, in ancient Spanish dress, with a coronet all sparkling with\n",
       "diamonds, and her hair entwined with pearls, who was softly playing on a\n",
       "silver lyre. The little Sanchica now recollected a story she had heard\n",
       "among the old people of the Alhambra, concerning a Gothic princess\n",
       "confined in the centre of the mountain by an old Arabian magician, whom\n",
       "she kept bound up in magic sleep by the power of music.\n",
       "\n",
       "The lady paused with surprise at seeing a mortal in that enchanted hall.\n",
       "“Is it the eve of the blessed St. John?” said she.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It is,” replied Sanchica.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then for one night the magic charm is suspended. Come hither, child,\n",
       "and fear not. I am a Christian like thyself, though bound here by\n",
       "enchantment. Touch my fetters with the talisman that hangs about thy\n",
       "neck, and for this night I shall be free.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So saying, she opened her robes and displayed a broad golden band round\n",
       "her waist, and a golden chain that fastened her to the ground. The child\n",
       "hesitated not to apply the little hand of jet to the golden band, and\n",
       "immediately the chain fell to the earth. At the sound the old man woke\n",
       "and began to rub his eyes; but the lady ran her fingers over the chords\n",
       "of the lyre, and again he fell into a slumber and began to nod, and his\n",
       "staff to falter in his hand. “Now,” said the lady, “touch his staff with\n",
       "the talismanic hand of jet.” The child did so, and it fell from his\n",
       "grasp, and he sank in a deep sleep on the ottoman. The lady gently laid\n",
       "the silver lyre on the ottoman, leaning it against the head of the\n",
       "sleeping magician; then touching the chords until they vibrated in his\n",
       "ear,--“O potent spirit of harmony,” said she, “continue thus to hold his\n",
       "senses in thraldom till the return of day. Now follow me, my child,”\n",
       "continued she, “and thou shalt behold the Alhambra as it was in the days\n",
       "of its glory, for thou hast a magic talisman that reveals all\n",
       "enchantments.” Sanchica followed the lady in silence. They passed up\n",
       "through the entrance of the cavern into the barbican of the Gate of\n",
       "Justice, and thence to the Plaza de los Algibes, or esplanade within the\n",
       "fortress.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was all filled with Moorish soldiery, horse and foot, marshalled in\n",
       "squadrons, with banners displayed. There were royal guards also at the\n",
       "portal, and rows of African blacks with drawn cimeters. No one spoke a\n",
       "word, and Sanchica passed on fearlessly after her conductor. Her\n",
       "astonishment increased on entering the royal palace, in which she had\n",
       "been reared. The broad moonshine lit up all the halls and courts and\n",
       "gardens almost as brightly as if it were day, but revealed a far\n",
       "different scene from that to which she was accustomed. The walls of the\n",
       "apartments were no longer stained and rent by time. Instead of cobwebs,\n",
       "they were now hung with rich silks of Damascus, and the gildings and\n",
       "arabesque paintings were restored to their original brilliancy and\n",
       "freshness. The halls, no longer naked and unfurnished, were set out with\n",
       "divans and ottomans of the rarest stuffs, embroidered with pearls and\n",
       "studded with precious gems, and all the fountains in the courts and\n",
       "gardens were playing.\n",
       "\n",
       "The kitchens were again in full operation; cooks were busy preparing\n",
       "shadowy dishes, and roasting and boiling the phantoms of pullets and\n",
       "partridges; servants were hurrying to and fro with silver dishes heaped\n",
       "up with dainties, and arranging a delicious banquet. The Court of Lions\n",
       "was thronged with guards, and courtiers, and alfaquis, as in the old\n",
       "times of the Moors; and at the upper end, in the saloon of judgment, sat\n",
       "Boabdil on his throne, surrounded by his court, and swaying a shadowy\n",
       "sceptre for the night. Notwithstanding all this throng and seeming\n",
       "bustle, not a voice nor a footstep was to be heard; nothing interrupted\n",
       "the midnight silence but the splashing of the fountains. The little\n",
       "Sanchica followed her conductress in mute amazement about the palace,\n",
       "until they came to a portal opening to the vaulted passages beneath the\n",
       "great Tower of Comares. On each side of the portal sat the figure of a\n",
       "nymph, wrought out of alabaster. Their heads were turned aside, and\n",
       "their regards fixed upon the same spot within the vault. The enchanted\n",
       "lady paused, and beckoned the child to her. “Here,” said she, “is a\n",
       "great secret, which I will reveal to thee in reward for thy faith and\n",
       "courage. These discreet statues watch over a treasure hidden in old\n",
       "times by a Moorish king. Tell thy father to search the spot on which\n",
       "their eyes are fixed, and he will find what will make him richer than\n",
       "any man in Granada. Thy innocent hands alone, however, gifted as thou\n",
       "art also with the talisman, can remove the treasure. Bid thy father use\n",
       "it discreetly, and devote a part of it to the performance of daily\n",
       "masses for my deliverance from this unholy enchantment.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When the lady had spoken these words, she led the child onward to the\n",
       "little garden of Lindaraxa, which is hard by the vault of the statues.\n",
       "The moon trembled upon the waters of the solitary fountain in the centre\n",
       "of the garden, and shed a tender light upon the orange and citron trees.\n",
       "The beautiful lady plucked a branch of myrtle and wreathed it round the\n",
       "head of the child. “Let this be a memento,” said she, “of what I have\n",
       "revealed to thee, and a testimonial of its truth. My hour is come; I\n",
       "must return to the enchanted hall; follow me not, lest evil befall\n",
       "thee;--farewell. Remember what I have said, and have masses performed\n",
       "for my deliverance.” So saying, the lady entered a dark passage leading\n",
       "beneath the Tower of Comares, and was no longer seen.\n",
       "\n",
       "The faint crowing of a cock was now heard from the cottages below the\n",
       "Alhambra, in the valley of the Darro, and a pale streak of light began\n",
       "to appear above the eastern mountains. A slight wind arose, there was a\n",
       "sound like the rustling of dry leaves through the courts and corridors,\n",
       "and door after door shut to with a jarring sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sanchica returned to the scenes she had so lately beheld thronged with\n",
       "the shadowy multitude, but Boabdil and his phantom court were gone. The\n",
       "moon shone into empty halls and galleries stripped of their transient\n",
       "splendor, stained and dilapidated by time, and hung with cobwebs. The\n",
       "bat flitted about in the uncertain light, and the frog croaked from the\n",
       "fishpond.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sanchica now made the best of her way to a remote staircase that led up\n",
       "to the humble apartment occupied by her family. The door as usual was\n",
       "open, for Lope Sanchez was too poor to need bolt or bar; she crept\n",
       "quietly to her pallet, and, putting the myrtle wreath beneath her\n",
       "pillow, soon fell asleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the morning she related all that had befallen her to her father. Lope\n",
       "Sanchez, however, treated the whole as a mere dream, and laughed at the\n",
       "child for her credulity. He went forth to his customary labors in the\n",
       "garden, but had not been there long when his little daughter came\n",
       "running to him almost breathless. “Father! father!” cried she, “behold\n",
       "the myrtle wreath which the Moorish lady bound round my head.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Lope Sanchez gazed with astonishment, for the stalk of the myrtle was of\n",
       "pure gold, and every leaf was a sparkling emerald! Being not much\n",
       "accustomed to precious stones, he was ignorant of the real value of the\n",
       "wreath, but he saw enough to convince him that it was something more\n",
       "substantial than the stuff of which dreams are generally made, and that\n",
       "at any rate the child had dreamt to some purpose. His first care was to\n",
       "enjoin the most absolute secrecy upon his daughter; in this respect,\n",
       "however, he was secure, for she had discretion far beyond her years or\n",
       "sex. He then repaired to the vault, where stood the statues of the two\n",
       "alabaster nymphs. He remarked that their heads were turned from the\n",
       "portal, and that the regards of each were fixed upon the same point in\n",
       "the interior of the building. Lope Sanchez could not but admire this\n",
       "most discreet contrivance for guarding a secret. He drew a line from the\n",
       "eyes of the statues to the point of regard, made a private mark on the\n",
       "wall, and then retired.\n",
       "\n",
       "All day, however, the mind of Lope Sanchez was distracted with a\n",
       "thousand cares. He could not help hovering within distant view of the\n",
       "two statues, and became nervous from the dread that the golden secret\n",
       "might be discovered. Every footstep that approached the place made him\n",
       "tremble. He would have given anything could he but have turned the heads\n",
       "of the statues, forgetting that they had looked precisely in the same\n",
       "direction for some hundreds of years, without any person being the\n",
       "wiser.\n",
       "\n",
       "“A plague upon them,” he would say to himself, “they’ll betray all; did\n",
       "ever mortal hear of such a mode of guarding a secret?” Then on hearing\n",
       "any one advance, he would steal off, as though his very lurking near the\n",
       "place would awaken suspicion. Then he would return cautiously, and peep\n",
       "from a distance to see if everything was secure, but the sight of the\n",
       "statues would again call forth his indignation. “Ay, there they stand,”\n",
       "would he say, “always looking, and looking, and looking, just where they\n",
       "should not. Confound them! they are just like all their sex; if they\n",
       "have not tongues to tattle with they’ll be sure to do it with their\n",
       "eyes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "At length, to his relief, the long anxious day drew to a close. The\n",
       "sound of footsteps was no longer heard in the echoing halls of the\n",
       "Alhambra; the last stranger passed the threshold, the great portal was\n",
       "barred and bolted, and the bat and the frog and the hooting owl\n",
       "gradually resumed their nightly vocations in the deserted palace.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lope Sanchez waited, however, until the night was far advanced before he\n",
       "ventured with his little daughter to the hall of the two nymphs. He\n",
       "found them looking as knowingly and mysteriously as ever at the secret\n",
       "place of deposit. “By your leaves, gentle ladies,” thought Lope Sanchez,\n",
       "as he passed between them, “I will relieve you from this charge that\n",
       "must have set so heavy in your minds for the last two or three\n",
       "centuries.” He accordingly went to work at the part of the wall which he\n",
       "had marked, and in a little while laid open a concealed recess, in which\n",
       "stood two great jars of porcelain. He attempted to draw them forth, but\n",
       "they were immovable, until touched by the innocent hand of his little\n",
       "daughter. With her aid he dislodged them from their niche, and found, to\n",
       "his great joy, that they were filled with pieces of Moorish gold,\n",
       "mingled with jewels and precious stones. Before daylight he managed to\n",
       "convey them to his chamber, and left the two guardian statues with their\n",
       "eyes still fixed on the vacant wall.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lope Sanchez had thus on a sudden become a rich man; but riches, as\n",
       "usual, brought a world of cares to which he had hitherto been a\n",
       "stranger. How was he to convey away his wealth with safety? How was he\n",
       "even to enter upon the enjoyment of it without awakening suspicion? Now,\n",
       "too, for the first time in his life the dread of robbers entered into\n",
       "his mind. He looked with terror at the insecurity of his habitation, and\n",
       "went to work to barricade the doors and windows; yet after all his\n",
       "precautions he could not sleep soundly. His usual gayety was at an end,\n",
       "he had no longer a joke or a song for his neighbors, and, in short,\n",
       "became the most miserable animal in the Alhambra. His old comrades\n",
       "remarked this alteration, pitied him heartily, and began to desert him;\n",
       "thinking he must be falling into want, and in danger of looking to them\n",
       "for assistance. Little did they suspect that his only calamity was\n",
       "riches.\n",
       "\n",
       "The wife of Lope Sanchez shared his anxiety, but then she had ghostly\n",
       "comfort. We ought before this to have mentioned that, Lope being rather\n",
       "a light inconsiderate little man, his wife was accustomed, in all grave\n",
       "matters, to seek the counsel and ministry of her confessor Fray Simon, a\n",
       "sturdy, broad-shouldered, blue-bearded, bullet-headed friar of the\n",
       "neighboring convent of San Francisco, who was in fact the spiritual\n",
       "comforter of half the good wives of the neighborhood. He was moreover in\n",
       "great esteem among divers sisterhoods of nuns; who requited him for his\n",
       "ghostly services by frequent presents of those little dainties and\n",
       "knick-knacks manufactured in convents, such as delicate confections,\n",
       "sweet biscuits, and bottles of spiced cordials, found to be marvellous\n",
       "restoratives after fasts and vigils.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fray Simon thrived in the exercise of his functions. His oily skin\n",
       "glistened in the sunshine as he toiled up the hill of the Alhambra on a\n",
       "sultry day. Yet notwithstanding his sleek condition, the knotted rope\n",
       "round his waist showed the austerity of his self-discipline; the\n",
       "multitude doffed their caps to him as a mirror of piety, and even the\n",
       "dogs scented the odor of sanctity that exhaled from his garments, and\n",
       "howled from their kennels as he passed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Such was Fray Simon, the spiritual counsellor of the comely wife of Lope\n",
       "Sanchez; and as the father confessor is the domestic confidant of women\n",
       "in humble life in Spain, he was soon acquainted, in great secrecy, with\n",
       "the story of the hidden treasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "The friar opened his eyes and mouth, and crossed himself a dozen times\n",
       "at the news. After a moment’s pause, “Daughter of my soul!” said he,\n",
       "“know that thy husband has committed a double sin--a sin against both\n",
       "state and church! The treasure he hath thus seized upon for himself,\n",
       "being found in the royal domains, belongs of course to the crown; but\n",
       "being infidel wealth, rescued as it were from the very fangs of Satan,\n",
       "should be devoted to the church. Still, however, the matter may be\n",
       "accommodated. Bring hither thy myrtle wreath.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When the good father beheld it, his eyes twinkled more than ever with\n",
       "admiration of the size and beauty of the emeralds. “This,” said he,\n",
       "“being the first-fruits of this discovery, should be dedicated to pious\n",
       "purposes. I will hang it up as a votive offering before the image of San\n",
       "Francisco in our chapel, and will earnestly pray to him, this very\n",
       "night, that your husband be permitted to remain in quiet possession of\n",
       "your wealth.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The good dame was delighted to make her peace with heaven at so cheap a\n",
       "rate, and the friar, putting the wreath under his mantle, departed with\n",
       "saintly steps toward his convent.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Lope Sanchez came home, his wife told him what had passed. He was\n",
       "excessively provoked, for he lacked his wife’s devotion, and had for\n",
       "some time groaned in secret at the domestic visitations of the friar.\n",
       "“Woman,” said he, “what hast thou done? thou hast put everything at\n",
       "hazard by thy tattling.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What!” cried the good woman, “would you forbid my disburdening my\n",
       "conscience to my confessor?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“No, wife! confess as many of your own sins as you please; but as to\n",
       "this money-digging, it is a sin of my own, and my conscience is very\n",
       "easy under the weight of it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "There was no use, however, in complaining; the secret was told, and,\n",
       "like water spilled on the sand, was not again to be gathered. Their only\n",
       "chance was, that the friar would be discreet.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next day, while Lope Sanchez was abroad, there was an humble\n",
       "knocking at the door, and Fray Simon entered with meek and demure\n",
       "countenance.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Daughter,” said he, “I have earnestly prayed to San Francisco, and he\n",
       "has heard my prayer. In the dead of the night the saint appeared to me\n",
       "in a dream, but with a frowning aspect. ‘Why,’ said he, ‘dost thou pray\n",
       "to me to dispense with this treasure of the Gentiles, when thou seest\n",
       "the poverty of my chapel? Go to the house of Lope Sanchez, crave in my\n",
       "name a portion of the Moorish gold, to furnish two candlesticks for the\n",
       "main altar, and let him possess the residue in peace.’”\n",
       "\n",
       "When the good woman heard of this vision, she crossed herself with awe,\n",
       "and going to the secret place where Lope had hid the treasure, she\n",
       "filled a great leathern purse with pieces of Moorish gold, and gave it\n",
       "to the friar. The pious monk bestowed upon her, in return, benedictions\n",
       "enough, if paid by Heaven, to enrich her race to the latest posterity;\n",
       "then slipping the purse into the sleeve of his habit, he folded his\n",
       "hands upon his breast, and departed with an air of humble thankfulness.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Lope Sanchez heard of this second donation to the church, he had\n",
       "wellnigh lost his senses. “Unfortunate man,” cried he, “what will become\n",
       "of me? I shall be robbed by piecemeal; I shall be ruined and brought to\n",
       "beggary.”\n",
       "\n",
       "It was with the utmost difficulty that his wife could pacify him, by\n",
       "reminding him of the countless wealth that yet remained, and how\n",
       "considerate it was for San Francisco to rest contented with so small a\n",
       "portion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unluckily, Fray Simon had a number of poor relations to be provided for,\n",
       "not to mention some half-dozen sturdy bullet-headed orphan children and\n",
       "destitute foundlings that he had taken under his care. He repeated his\n",
       "visits, therefore, from day to day, with solicitations on behalf of\n",
       "Saint Dominick, Saint Andrew, Saint James, until poor Lope was driven to\n",
       "despair, and found that unless he got out of the reach of this holy\n",
       "friar, he should have to make peace-offerings to every saint in the\n",
       "calendar. He determined, therefore, to pack up his remaining wealth,\n",
       "beat a secret retreat in the night, and make off to another part of the\n",
       "kingdom.\n",
       "\n",
       "Full of his project, he bought a stout mule for the purpose, and\n",
       "tethered it in a gloomy vault underneath the tower of the seven floors;\n",
       "the very place whence the Belludo, or goblin horse, is said to issue\n",
       "forth at midnight, and scour the streets of Granada, pursued by a pack\n",
       "of hell-hounds. Lope Sanchez had little faith in the story, but availed\n",
       "himself of the dread occasioned by it, knowing that no one would be\n",
       "likely to pry into the subterranean stable of the phantom steed. He sent\n",
       "off his family in the course of the day, with orders to wait for him at\n",
       "a distant village of the Vega. As the night advanced, he conveyed his\n",
       "treasure to the vault under the tower, and having loaded his mule, he\n",
       "led it forth, and cautiously descended the dusky avenue.\n",
       "\n",
       "Honest Lope had taken his measures with the utmost secrecy, imparting\n",
       "them to no one but the faithful wife of his bosom. By some miraculous\n",
       "revelation, however, they became known to Fray Simon. The zealous friar\n",
       "beheld these infidel treasures on the point of slipping forever out of\n",
       "his grasp, and determined to have one more dash at them for the benefit\n",
       "of the church and San Francisco. Accordingly, when the bells had rung\n",
       "for animas, and all the Alhambra was quiet, he stole out of his convent,\n",
       "and descending through the Gate of Justice, concealed himself among the\n",
       "thickets of roses and laurels that border the great avenue. Here he\n",
       "remained, counting the quarters of hours as they were sounded on the\n",
       "bell of the watchtower, and listening to the dreary hootings of owls,\n",
       "and the distant barking of dogs from the gypsy caverns.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length he heard the tramp of hoofs, and, through the gloom of the\n",
       "overshading trees, imperfectly beheld a steed descending the avenue. The\n",
       "sturdy friar chuckled at the idea of the knowing turn he was about to\n",
       "serve honest Lope.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tucking up the skirts of his habit, and wriggling like a cat watching a\n",
       "mouse, he waited until his prey was directly before him, when darting\n",
       "forth from his leafy covert, and putting one hand on the shoulder and\n",
       "the other on the crupper, he made a vault that would not have disgraced\n",
       "the most experienced master of equitation, and alighted well-forked\n",
       "astride the steed. “Ah ha!” said the sturdy friar, “we shall now see who\n",
       "best understands the game.” He had scarce uttered the words when the\n",
       "mule began to kick, and rear, and plunge, and then set off full speed\n",
       "down the hill. The friar attempted to check him, but in vain. He bounded\n",
       "from rock to rock, and bush to bush; the friar’s habit was torn to\n",
       "ribbons and fluttered in the wind, his shaven poll received many a hard\n",
       "knock from the branches of the trees, and many a scratch from the\n",
       "brambles. To add to his terror and distress, he found a pack of seven\n",
       "hounds in full cry at his heels, and perceived, too late, that he was\n",
       "actually mounted upon the terrible Belludo!\n",
       "\n",
       "Away then they went, according to the ancient phrase, “pull devil, pull\n",
       "friar,” down the great avenue, across the Plaza Nueva, along the\n",
       "Zacatin, around the Vivarrambla--never did huntsman and hound make a\n",
       "more furious run, or more infernal uproar. In vain did the friar invoke\n",
       "every saint in the calendar, and the holy Virgin into the bargain; every\n",
       "time he mentioned a name of the kind it was like a fresh application of\n",
       "the spur, and made the Belludo bound as high as a house. Through the\n",
       "remainder of the night was the unlucky Fray Simon carried hither and\n",
       "thither, and whither he would not, until every bone in his body ached,\n",
       "and he suffered a loss of leather too grievous to be mentioned. At\n",
       "length the crowing of a cock gave the signal of returning day. At the\n",
       "sound the goblin steed wheeled about, and galloped back for his tower.\n",
       "Again he scoured the Vivarrambla, the Zacatin, the Plaza Nueva, and the\n",
       "avenue of fountains, the seven dogs yelling, and barking, and leaping\n",
       "up, and snapping at the heels of the terrified friar. The first streak\n",
       "of day had just appeared as they reached the tower; here the goblin\n",
       "steed kicked up his heels, sent the friar a summerset through the air,\n",
       "plunged into the dark vault followed by the infernal pack, and a\n",
       "profound silence succeeded to the late deafening clamor.\n",
       "\n",
       "Was ever so diabolical a trick played off upon a holy friar? A peasant\n",
       "going to his labors at early dawn found the unfortunate Fray Simon lying\n",
       "under a fig-tree at the foot of the tower, but so bruised and bedevilled\n",
       "that he could neither speak nor move. He was conveyed with all care and\n",
       "tenderness to his cell, and the story went that he had been waylaid and\n",
       "maltreated by robbers. A day or two elapsed before he recovered the use\n",
       "of his limbs; he consoled himself, in the mean time, with the thoughts\n",
       "that though the mule with the treasure had escaped him, he had\n",
       "previously had some rare pickings at the infidel spoils. His first care\n",
       "on being able to use his limbs, was to search beneath his pallet, where\n",
       "he had secreted the myrtle wreath and the leathern pouches of gold\n",
       "extracted from the piety of Dame Sanchez. What was his dismay at finding\n",
       "the wreath, in effect, but a withered branch of myrtle, and the leathern\n",
       "pouches filled with sand and gravel!\n",
       "\n",
       "Fray Simon, with all his chagrin, had the discretion to hold his tongue,\n",
       "for to betray the secret might draw on him the ridicule of the public,\n",
       "and the punishment of his superior. It was not until many years\n",
       "afterwards, on his death-bed, that he revealed to his confessor his\n",
       "nocturnal ride on the Belludo.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing was heard of Lope Sanchez for a long time after his\n",
       "disappearance from the Alhambra. His memory was always cherished as that\n",
       "of a merry companion, though it was feared, from the care and melancholy\n",
       "observed in his conduct shortly before his mysterious departure, that\n",
       "poverty and distress had driven him to some extremity. Some years\n",
       "afterwards one of his old companions, an invalid soldier, being at\n",
       "Malaga, was knocked down and nearly run over by a coach and six. The\n",
       "carriage stopped; an old gentleman, magnificently dressed, with a\n",
       "bag-wig and sword, stepped out to assist the poor invalid. What was the\n",
       "astonishment of the latter to behold in this grand cavalier his old\n",
       "friend Lope Sanchez, who was actually celebrating the marriage of his\n",
       "daughter Sanchica with one of the first grandees in the land.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "In the course of a morning’s research among the old chronicles in the\n",
       "Library of the University, I came upon a little episode in the history\n",
       "of Granada, so strongly characteristic of the bigot zeal which sometimes\n",
       "inflamed the Christian enterprises against this splendid but devoted\n",
       "city, that I was tempted to draw it forth from the parchment-bound\n",
       "volume in which it lay entombed, and submit it to the reader.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the year of redemption, 1394, there was a valiant and devout grand\n",
       "master of Alcántara, named Martin Yañez de Barbudo, who was inflamed\n",
       "with a vehement desire to serve God and fight the Moors. Unfortunately\n",
       "for this brave and pious cavalier, a profound peace existed between the\n",
       "Christian and Moslem powers. Henry III had just ascended the throne of\n",
       "Castile, and Yusef ben Mohammed had succeeded to the throne of Granada,\n",
       "and both were disposed to continue the peace which had prevailed between\n",
       "their fathers. The grand master looked with repining at Moorish banners\n",
       "and weapons, which decorated his castle-hall, trophies of the exploits\n",
       "of his predecessors; and repined at his fate to exist in a period of\n",
       "such inglorious tranquillity.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length his impatience broke through all bounds, and seeing that he\n",
       "could find no public war in which to engage, he resolved to carve out a\n",
       "little war for himself. Such at least is the account given by some\n",
       "ancient chronicles, though others give the following as the motive for\n",
       "this sudden resolution to go campaigning.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the grand master was one day seated at table with several of his\n",
       "cavaliers, a man suddenly entered the hall,--tall, meagre, and bony,\n",
       "with haggard countenance and fiery eye. All recognized him for a hermit,\n",
       "who had been a soldier in his youth, but now led a life of penitence in\n",
       "a cave. He advanced to the table and struck upon it with a fist that\n",
       "seemed of iron. “Cavaliers,” said he, “why sit ye here idly, with your\n",
       "weapons resting against the wall, while the enemies of the faith lord it\n",
       "over the fairest portion of the land?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Holy father, what wouldst thou have us do,” asked the grand master,\n",
       "“seeing the wars are over and our swords bound up by treaties of peace?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Listen to my words,” replied the hermit. “As I was seated late at night\n",
       "at the entrance of my cave, contemplating the heavens, I fell into a\n",
       "reverie, and a wonderful vision was presented to me. I beheld the moon,\n",
       "a mere crescent, yet luminous as the brightest silver, and it hung in\n",
       "the heavens over the kingdom of Granada. While I was looking at it,\n",
       "behold there shot forth from the firmament a blazing star, which, as it\n",
       "went, drew after it all the stars of heaven; and they assailed the moon\n",
       "and drove it from the skies; and the whole firmament was filled with the\n",
       "glory of that blazing star. While mine eyes were yet dazzled by this\n",
       "wondrous sight, some one stood by me with snowy wings and a shining\n",
       "countenance. ‘Oh man of prayer,’ said he, ‘get thee to the grand master\n",
       "of Alcántara and tell him of the vision thou hast beheld. He is the\n",
       "blazing star, destined to drive the crescent, the Moslem emblem, from\n",
       "the land. Let him boldly draw the sword and continue the good work begun\n",
       "by Pelazo of old, and victory will assuredly attend his banner.’”\n",
       "\n",
       "The grand master listened to the hermit as to a messenger from heaven,\n",
       "and followed his counsel in all things. By his advice he dispatched two\n",
       "of his stoutest warriors, armed _cap-à-pie_, on an embassy to the\n",
       "Moorish king. They entered the gates of Granada without molestation, as\n",
       "the nations were at peace; and made their way to the Alhambra, where\n",
       "they were promptly admitted to the king, who received them in the Hall\n",
       "of Ambassadors. They delivered their message roundly and hardly. “We\n",
       "come, O King, from Don Martin Tañez de Barbudo, grand master of\n",
       "Alcántara; who affirms the faith of Jesus Christ to be true and holy,\n",
       "and that of Mahomet false and detestable, and he challenges thee to\n",
       "maintain the contrary, hand to hand, in single combat. Shouldst thou\n",
       "refuse, he offers to combat with one hundred cavaliers against two\n",
       "hundred; or, in like proportion, to the number of one thousand, always\n",
       "allowing thy faith a double number of champions. Remember, O King, that\n",
       "thou canst not refuse this challenge; since thy prophet, knowing the\n",
       "impossibility of maintaining his doctrines by argument, has commanded\n",
       "his followers to enforce them with the sword.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The beard of King Yusef trembled with indignation. “The master of\n",
       "Alcántara,” said he, “is a madman to send such a message, and ye are\n",
       "saucy knaves to bring it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So saying, he ordered the ambassadors to be thrown into a dungeon, by\n",
       "way of giving them a lesson in diplomacy; and they were roughly treated\n",
       "on their way thither by the populace, who were exasperated at this\n",
       "insult to their sovereign and their faith.\n",
       "\n",
       "The grand master of Alcántara could scarcely credit the tidings of the\n",
       "maltreatment of his messengers; but the hermit rejoiced when they were\n",
       "repeated to him. “God,” said he, “has blinded this infidel king for his\n",
       "downfall. Since he has sent no reply to thy defiance, consider it\n",
       "accepted. Marshal thy forces, therefore; march forward to Granada; pause\n",
       "not until thou seest the gate of Elvira. A miracle will be wrought in\n",
       "thy favor. There will be a great battle; the enemy will be overthrown;\n",
       "but not one of thy soldiers will be slain.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The grand master called upon every warrior zealous in the Christian\n",
       "cause to aid him in this crusade. In a little while three hundred\n",
       "horsemen and a thousand foot-soldiers rallied under his standard. The\n",
       "horsemen were veterans, seasoned to battle and well-armed; but the\n",
       "infantry were raw and undisciplined. The victory, however, was to be\n",
       "miraculous; the grand master was a man of surpassing faith, and knew\n",
       "that the weaker the means the greater the miracle. He sallied forth\n",
       "confidently, therefore, with his little army, and the hermit strode\n",
       "ahead, bearing a cross on the end of a long pole, and beneath it the\n",
       "pennon of the order of Alcántara.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they approached the city of Cordova they were overtaken by\n",
       "messengers, spurring in all haste, bearing missives from the Castilian\n",
       "monarch, forbidding the enterprise. The grand master was a man of a\n",
       "single mind and a single will; in other words, a man of one idea. “Were\n",
       "I on any other errand,” said he, “I should obey these letters as coming\n",
       "from my lord the king; but I am sent by a higher power than the king. In\n",
       "compliance with its commands I have advanced the cross thus far against\n",
       "the infidels; and it would be treason to the standard of Christ to turn\n",
       "back without achieving my errand.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So the trumpets were sounded; the cross was again reared aloft, and the\n",
       "band of zealots resumed their march. As they passed through the streets\n",
       "of Cordova the people were amazed at beholding a hermit bearing a cross\n",
       "at the head of a warlike multitude; but when they learnt that a\n",
       "miraculous victory was to be effected and Granada destroyed, laborers\n",
       "and artisans threw by the implements of their handicrafts and joined in\n",
       "the crusade; while a mercenary rabble followed on with a view of\n",
       "plunder.\n",
       "\n",
       "A number of cavaliers of rank who lacked faith in the promised miracle,\n",
       "and dreaded the consequences of this unprovoked irruption into the\n",
       "country of the Moor, assembled at the bridge of the Guadalquivir and\n",
       "endeavored to dissuade the grand master from crossing. He was deaf to\n",
       "prayers, expostulations, or menaces; his followers were enraged at this\n",
       "opposition to the cause of the faith; they put an end to the parley by\n",
       "their clamors; the cross was again reared and borne triumphantly across\n",
       "the bridge.\n",
       "\n",
       "The multitude increased as it proceeded; by the time the grand master\n",
       "had reached Alcala la Real, which stands on a mountain overlooking the\n",
       "Vega of Granada, upwards of five thousand men on foot had joined his\n",
       "standard.\n",
       "\n",
       "At Alcala came forth Alonzo Fernandez de Cordova, Lord of Aguilar, his\n",
       "brother Diego Fernandez, Marshal of Castile, and other cavaliers of\n",
       "valor and experience. Placing themselves in the way of the grand master,\n",
       "“What madness is this, Don Martin?” said they; “the Moorish king has two\n",
       "hundred thousand foot-soldiers and five thousand horse within his walls;\n",
       "what can you and your handful of cavaliers and your noisy rabble do\n",
       "against such force? Bethink you of the disasters which have befallen\n",
       "other Christian commanders, who have crossed these rocky borders with\n",
       "ten times your force. Think, too, of the mischief that will be brought\n",
       "upon this kingdom by an outrage of the kind committed by a man of your\n",
       "rank and importance, a grand master of Alcántara. Pause, we entreat you,\n",
       "while the truce is yet unbroken. Await within the borders the reply of\n",
       "the king of Granada to your challenge. If he agree to meet you singly,\n",
       "or with champions two or three, it will be your individual contest, and\n",
       "fight it out in God’s name; if he refuse, you may return home with great\n",
       "honor and the disgrace will fall upon the Moors.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Several cavaliers, who had hitherto followed the grand master with\n",
       "devoted zeal, were moved by these expostulations, and suggested to him\n",
       "the policy of listening to this advice.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Cavaliers,” said he, addressing himself to Alonzo Fernandez de Cordova\n",
       "and his companions, “I thank you for the counsel you have so kindly\n",
       "bestowed upon me, and if I were merely in pursuit of individual glory I\n",
       "might be swayed by it. But I am engaged to achieve a great triumph of\n",
       "the faith, which God is to effect by miracle through my means. As to\n",
       "you, cavaliers,” turning to those of his followers who had wavered, “if\n",
       "your hearts fail you, or you repent of having put your hands to this\n",
       "good work, return, in God’s name, and my blessing go with you. For\n",
       "myself, though I have none to stand by me but this holy hermit, yet will\n",
       "I assuredly proceed; until I have planted this sacred standard on the\n",
       "walls of Granada, or perished in the attempt.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Don Martin Yañez de Barbudo,” replied the cavaliers, “we are not men to\n",
       "turn our backs upon our commander, however rash his enterprise. We spoke\n",
       "but in caution. Lead on, therefore, and if it be to the death, be\n",
       "assured to the death we will follow thee.”\n",
       "\n",
       "By this time the common soldiers became impatient. “Forward! forward!”\n",
       "shouted they. “Forward in the cause of faith.” So the grand master gave\n",
       "signal, the hermit again reared the cross aloft, and they poured down a\n",
       "defile of the mountain, with solemn chants of triumph.\n",
       "\n",
       "That night they encamped at the river of Azores, and the next morning,\n",
       "which was Sunday, crossed the borders. Their first pause was at an\n",
       "atalaya or solitary tower, built upon a rock; a frontier post to keep a\n",
       "watch upon the border, and give notice of invasion. It was thence called\n",
       "el Torre del Exea (the tower of the spy). The grand master halted before\n",
       "it and summoned its petty garrison to surrender. He was answered by a\n",
       "shower of stones and arrows, which wounded him in the hand and killed\n",
       "three of his men.\n",
       "\n",
       "“How is this, father?” said he to the hermit; “you assured me that not\n",
       "one of my followers would be slain!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“True, my son; but I meant in the great battle of the infidel king; what\n",
       "need is there of miracle to aid in the capture of a petty tower?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The grand master was satisfied. He ordered wood to be piled against the\n",
       "door of the tower to burn it down. In the mean time provisions were\n",
       "unloaded from the sumpter-mules, and the crusaders, withdrawing beyond\n",
       "bow-shot, sat down on the grass to a repast to strengthen them for the\n",
       "arduous day’s work before them. While thus engaged, they were startled\n",
       "by the sudden appearance of a great Moorish host. The atalayas had given\n",
       "the alarm by fire and smoke from the mountain-tops of “an enemy across\n",
       "the border,” and the king of Granada had sallied forth with a great\n",
       "force to the encounter.\n",
       "\n",
       "The crusaders, nearly taken by surprise, flew to arms and prepared for\n",
       "battle. The grand master ordered his three hundred horsemen to dismount\n",
       "and fight on foot in support of the infantry. The Moors, however,\n",
       "charged so suddenly that they separated the cavaliers from the\n",
       "foot-soldiers and prevented their uniting. The grand master gave the old\n",
       "war-cry, “Santiago! Santiago! and close Spain!” He and his knights\n",
       "breasted the fury of the battle, but were surrounded by a countless host\n",
       "and assailed with arrows, stones, darts, and arquebuses. Still they\n",
       "fought fearlessly, and made prodigious slaughter. The hermit mingled in\n",
       "the hottest of the fight. In one hand he bore the cross, in the other\n",
       "he brandished a sword, with which he dealt about him like a maniac,\n",
       "slaying several of the enemy, until he sank to the ground covered with\n",
       "wounds. The grand master saw him fall, and saw too late the fallacy of\n",
       "his prophecies. Despair, however, only made him fight the more fiercely,\n",
       "until he also fell overpowered by numbers. His devoted cavaliers\n",
       "emulated his holy zeal. Not one turned his back nor asked for mercy; all\n",
       "fought until they fell. As to the foot-soldiers, many were killed, many\n",
       "taken prisoners; the residue escaped to Alcala la Real. When the Moors\n",
       "came to strip the slain, the wounds of the cavaliers were all found to\n",
       "be in front.\n",
       "\n",
       "Such was the catastrophe of this fanatic enterprise. The Moors vaunted\n",
       "it as a decisive proof of the superior sanctity of their faith, and\n",
       "extolled their king to the skies when he returned in triumph to Granada.\n",
       "\n",
       "As it was satisfactorily shown that this crusade was the enterprise of\n",
       "an individual, and contrary to the express orders of the king of\n",
       "Castile, the peace of the two kingdoms was not interrupted. Nay, the\n",
       "Moors evinced a feeling of respect for the valor of the unfortunate\n",
       "grand master, and readily gave up his body to Don Alonzo Fernandez de\n",
       "Cordova, who came from Alcala to seek it. The Christians of the frontier\n",
       "united in paying the last sad honors to his memory. His body was placed\n",

       "disappointment, was borne before it. In this way his remains were\n",
       "carried back in funeral procession, through the mountain tract which he\n",
       "had traversed so resolutely. Wherever it passed, through a town or\n",
       "village, the populace followed, with tears and lamentations, bewailing\n",

       "Silos, in Castile, are the mouldering yet magnificent monuments of the\n",
       "once powerful and chivalrous family of Hinojosa. Among these reclines\n",
       "the marble figure of a knight, in complete armor, with the hands pressed\n",

       "In old times, several hundred years ago, there was a noble Castilian\n",
       "cavalier, named Don Munio Sancho de Hinojosa, lord of a border castle,\n",
       "which had stood the brunt of many a Moorish foray. He had seventy\n",
       "horsemen as his household troops, all of the ancient Castilian proof;\n",
       "stark warriors, hard riders, and men of iron; with these he scoured the\n",
       "Moorish lands, and made his name terrible throughout the borders. His\n",
       "castle-hall was covered with banners, cimeters, and Moslem helms, the\n",
       "trophies of his prowess. Don Munio was, moreover, a keen huntsman; and\n",
       "rejoiced in hounds of all kinds, steeds for the chase, and hawks for the\n",
       "towering sport of falconry. When not engaged in warfare his delight was\n",
       "to beat up the neighboring forests; and scarcely ever did he ride forth\n",
       "without hound and horn, a boar-spear in his hand, or a hawk upon his\n",
       "fist, and an attendant train of huntsmen.\n",
       "\n",
       "His wife, Doña Maria Palacin, was of a gentle and timid nature, little\n",
       "fitted to be the spouse of so hardy and adventurous a knight; and many a\n",
       "tear did the poor lady shed, when he sallied forth upon his daring\n",
       "enterprises, and many a prayer did she offer up for his safety.\n",
       "\n",
       "As this doughty cavalier was one day hunting, he stationed himself in a\n",
       "thicket, on the borders of a green glade of the forest, and dispersed\n",
       "his followers to rouse the game, and drive it toward his stand. He had\n",
       "not been here long, when a cavalcade of Moors, of both sexes, came\n",
       "prankling over the forest-lawn. They were unarmed, and magnificently\n",
       "dressed in robes of tissue and embroidery, rich shawls of India,\n",
       "bracelets and anklets of gold, and jewels that sparkled in the sun.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the head of this gay cavalcade rode a youthful cavalier, superior to\n",
       "the rest in dignity and loftiness of demeanor, and in splendor of\n",
       "attire: beside him was a damsel, whose veil, blown aside by the breeze,\n",
       "displayed a face of surpassing beauty, and eyes cast down in maiden\n",
       "modesty, yet beaming with tenderness and joy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Don Munio thanked his stars for sending him such a prize, and exulted at\n",
       "the thought of bearing home to his wife the glittering spoils of these\n",
       "infidels. Putting his hunting-horn to his lips, he gave a blast that\n",
       "rung through the forest. His huntsmen came running from all quarters,\n",
       "and the astonished Moors were surrounded and made captives.\n",
       "\n",
       "The beautiful Moor wrung her hands in despair, and her female attendants\n",
       "uttered the most piercing cries. The young Moorish cavalier alone\n",
       "retained self-possession. He inquired the name of the Christian knight\n",
       "who commanded this troop of horsemen. When told that it was Don Munio\n",
       "Sancho de Hinojosa, his countenance lighted up. Approaching that\n",
       "cavalier, and kissing his hand, “Don Munio Sancho,” said he, “I have\n",
       "heard of your fame as a true and valiant knight, terrible in arms, but\n",
       "schooled in the noble virtues of chivalry. Such do I trust to find you.\n",
       "In me you behold Abadil, son of a Moorish alcayde. I am on the way to\n",
       "celebrate my nuptials with this lady; chance has thrown us in your\n",
       "power, but I confide in your magnanimity. Take all our treasure and\n",
       "jewels; demand what ransom you think proper for our persons, but suffer\n",
       "us not to be insulted nor dishonored.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When the good knight heard this appeal, and beheld the beauty of the\n",
       "youthful pair, his heart was touched with tenderness and courtesy. “God\n",
       "forbid,” said he, “that I should disturb such happy nuptials. My\n",
       "prisoners in troth shall ye be for fifteen days, and immured within my\n",
       "castle, where I claim, as conqueror, the right of celebrating your\n",
       "espousals.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So saying, he dispatched one of his fleetest horsemen in advance, to\n",
       "notify Doña Maria Palacin of the coming of this bridal party; while he\n",
       "and his huntsmen escorted the cavalcade, not as captors, but as a guard\n",
       "of honor. As they drew near to the castle, the banners were hung out,\n",
       "and the trumpets sounded from the battlements; and on their nearer\n",
       "approach, the drawbridge was lowered, and Doña Maria came forth to meet\n",
       "them, attended by her ladies and knights, her pages and her minstrels.\n",
       "She took the young bride, Allifra, in her arms, kissed her with the\n",
       "tenderness of a sister, and conducted her into the castle. In the mean\n",
       "time, Don Munio sent forth missives in every direction, and had viands\n",
       "and dainties of all kinds collected from the country round; and the\n",
       "wedding of the Moorish lovers was celebrated with all possible state and\n",
       "festivity. For fifteen days the castle was given up to joy and revelry.\n",
       "There were tiltings and jousts at the ring, and bull-fights, and\n",
       "banquets, and dances to the sound of minstrelsy. When the fifteen days\n",
       "were at an end, he made the bride and bridegroom magnificent presents,\n",
       "and conducted them and their attendants safely beyond the borders. Such,\n",
       "in old times, were the courtesy and generosity of a Spanish cavalier.\n",
       "\n",
       "Several years after this event, the king of Castile summoned his nobles\n",
       "to assist him in a campaign against the Moors. Don Munio Sancho was\n",
       "among the first to answer to the call, with seventy horsemen, all stanch\n",
       "and well-tried warriors. His wife, Doña Maria, hung about his neck.\n",
       "“Alas, my lord!” exclaimed she, “how often wilt thou tempt thy fate, and\n",
       "when will thy thirst for glory be appeased!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“One battle more,” replied Don Munio, “one battle more, for the honor of\n",
       "Castile, and I here make a vow, that when this is over, I will lay by my\n",
       "sword, and repair with my cavaliers in pilgrimage to the sepulchre of\n",
       "our Lord at Jerusalem.” The cavaliers all joined with him in the vow,\n",
       "and Doña Maria felt in some degree soothed in spirit; still, she saw\n",
       "with a heavy heart the departure of her husband, and watched his banner\n",
       "with wistful eyes, until it disappeared among the trees of the forest.\n",
       "\n",
       "The king of Castile led his army to the plains of Salmanara, where they\n",
       "encountered the Moorish host, near to Ucles. The battle was long and\n",
       "bloody; the Christians repeatedly wavered and were as often rallied by\n",
       "the energy of their commanders. Don Munio was covered with wounds, but\n",
       "refused to leave the field. The Christians at length gave way, and the\n",
       "king was hardly pressed, and in danger of being captured.\n",
       "\n",
       "Don Munio called upon his cavaliers to follow him to the rescue. “Now is\n",
       "the time,” cried he, “to prove your loyalty. Fall to, like brave men! We\n",
       "fight for the true faith, and if we lose our lives here, we gain a\n",
       "better life hereafter.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Rushing with his men between the king and his pursuers, they checked the\n",
       "latter in their career, and gave time for their monarch to escape; but\n",
       "they fell victims to their loyalty. They all fought to the last gasp.\n",
       "Don Munio was singled out by a powerful Moorish knight, but having been\n",
       "wounded in the right arm, he fought to disadvantage, and was slain. The\n",
       "battle being over, the Moor paused to possess himself of the spoils of\n",
       "this redoubtable Christian warrior. When he unlaced the helmet, however,\n",
       "and beheld the countenance of Don Munio, he gave a great cry and smote\n",
       "his breast. “Woe is me!” cried he, “I have slain my benefactor! The\n",
       "flower of knightly virtue! the most magnanimous of cavaliers!”\n",
       "\n",
       "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
       "\n",
       "While the battle had been raging on the plain of Salmanara, Doña Maria\n",
       "Palacin remained in her castle, a prey to the keenest anxiety. Her eyes\n",
       "were ever fixed on the road that led from the country of the Moors, and\n",
       "often she asked the watchman of the tower, “What seest thou?”\n",
       "\n",
       "One evening, at the shadowy hour of twilight, the warden sounded his\n",
       "horn. “I see,” cried he, “a numerous train winding up the valley. There\n",
       "are mingled Moors and Christians. The banner of my lord is in the\n",
       "advance. Joyful tidings!” exclaimed the old seneschal; “my lord returns\n",
       "in triumph, and brings captives!” Then the castle courts rang with\n",
       "shouts of joy; and the standard was displayed, and the trumpets were\n",
       "sounded, and the drawbridge was lowered, and Doña Maria went forth with\n",
       "her ladies, and her knights, and her pages, and her minstrels, to\n",
       "welcome her lord from the wars. But as the train drew nigh, she beheld a\n",
       "sumptuous bier, covered with black velvet, and on it lay a warrior, as\n",
       "if taking his repose: he lay in his armor, with his helmet on his head,\n",
       "and his sword in his hand, as one who had never been conquered, and\n",
       "around the bier were the escutcheons of the house of Hinojosa.\n",
       "\n",
       "A number of Moorish cavaliers attended the bier, with emblems of\n",
       "mourning, and with dejected countenances; and their leader cast himself\n",
       "at the feet of Doña Maria, and hid his face in his hands. She beheld in\n",
       "him the gallant Abadil, whom she had once welcomed with his bride to her\n",
       "castle; but who now came with the body of her lord, whom he had\n",
       "unknowingly slain in battle!\n",

       "\n",
       "The sepulchre erected in the cloisters of the convent of San Domingo,\n",
       "was achieved at the expense of the Moor Abadil, as a feeble testimony of\n",
       "his grief for the death of the good knight Don Munio, and his reverence\n",
       "for his memory. The tender and faithful Doña Maria soon followed her\n",
       "lord to the tomb. On one of the stones of a small arch, beside his\n",

       "chaplain of the Holy Temple at Jerusalem, while standing at the outer\n",
       "gate, beheld a train of Christian cavaliers advancing, as if in\n",
       "pilgrimage. The chaplain was a native of Spain, and as the pilgrims\n",
       "approached, he knew the foremost to be Don Munio Sancho de Hinojosa,\n",
       "with whom he had been well acquainted in former times. Hastening to the\n",

       "priests and monks, and received the pilgrims with all due honor. There\n",
       "were seventy cavaliers, beside their leader,--all stark and lofty\n",
       "warriors. They carried their helmets in their hands, and their faces\n",
       "were deadly pale. They greeted no one, nor looked either to the right or\n",
       "to the left, but entered the chapel, and kneeling before the sepulchre\n",
       "of our Saviour, performed their orisons in silence. When they had\n",
       "concluded, they rose as if to depart, and the patriarch and his\n",
       "attendants advanced to speak to them, but they were no more to be seen.\n",
       "Every one marvelled what could be the meaning of this prodigy. The\n",

       "la Real. His father designed him for public and military life, and would\n",
       "have made him his lieutenant; but the youth was of a poetical\n",

       "arts, and by the works of the learned; he divided his time between study\n",
       "and social enjoyment. He was fond of the sports of the field, and kept\n",
       "horses, hawks, and hounds. He devoted himself to literature, became\n",
       "renowned for erudition, and his compositions in prose and verse were\n",

       "\n",

       "both young, equal in merit, fame, rank, and fortune, enamored of each\n",
       "other’s genius as well as person, and inhabiting a region formed to be a\n",
       "realm of love and poetry. A poetical intercourse was carried on between\n",

       "government from Cordova to Morocco. The Sultan Abdelmuman governed Spain\n",
       "through his Walis and Alcaydes; and his son, Sidi Abu Said, was made\n",
       "Wali of Granada. He governed in his father’s name with royal state and\n",

       "Moor by birth, he sought to strengthen himself by drawing round him\n",
       "popular persons of the Arab race; and to this effect made Ahmed, who was\n",
       "then in the zenith of his fame and popularity, his vizier. Ahmed would\n",
       "have declined the post, but the Wali was peremptory. Its duties were\n",
       "irksome to him, and he spurned at its restraint. On a hawking-party,\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Maddened by jealousy and despair, Ahmed joined in a conspiracy against\n",
       "the ruling dynasty. It was discovered, and the conspirators fled from\n",
       "Granada. Some escaped to a castle on the mountains, Ahmed took refuge in\n",
       "Malaga, where he concealed himself, intending to embark for Valencia. He\n",

       "\n",
       "He was visited in prison by a nephew, who has left on record an account\n",

       "at least so I was privately informed by Mateo Ximenes, and various\n",

       "In the present instance, Dolores was less on the reserve, and had busied\n",

       "neatest order, and above all she had worked a smart Andalusian\n",

       "frequently observed him reading, apparently with intense interest, an\n",
       "old parchment-bound volume; sometimes he would be surrounded by a group\n",
       "of his brother invalids; some seated on the parapets, some lying on the\n",

       "deliberately out of his favorite work, sometimes pausing to explain or\n",
       "expound for the benefit of his less enlightened auditors.\n",
       "\n",
       "I took occasion one day to inform myself of this ancient book, which\n",
       "appeared to be his _vade mecum_, and found it to be an odd volume of the\n",
       "works of Padre Benito Geronymo Feyjoo; and that one which treats about\n",
       "the Magic of Spain, the mysterious caves of Salamanca and Toledo, the\n",

       "On the present occasion I amused myself with watching him fit out the\n",

       "saddle of antique fashion, high in front and behind, with Moorish\n",
       "stirrups like shovels; the whole looking like a relic of the old armory\n",
       "of the Alhambra; then a fleecy sheep-skin was accommodated to the deep\n",
       "seat of the saddle; then a maleta, neatly packed by the hand of Dolores,\n",
       "was buckled behind; then a manta was thrown over it to serve either as\n",
       "cloak or couch; then the all-important alforjas, carefully stocked with\n",
       "provant, were hung in front, together with the bota, or leathern bottle\n",
       "for either wine or water, and lastly the trabucho, which the old soldier\n",
       "slung behind, giving it his benediction. It was like the fitting out in\n",
       "old times of a Moorish cavalier for a foray or a joust in the\n",
       "Vivarrambla. A number of the lazzaroni of the fortress had gathered\n",

       "him off in military style; then turning to Dolores, who stood admiring\n",
       "her cavalier as he trotted off, “Ah Dolorocita,” exclaimed he, with a\n",
       "nod and a wink, “_es muy guapo Manuelito in su Xaqueta_,” (Ah Dolores,\n",
       "Manuel is mighty fine in his jacket.) The little damsel blushed and\n",
       "laughed, and ran into the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "Days elapsed without tidings from Manuel, though he had promised to\n",
       "write. The heart of Dolores began to misgive her. Had anything happened\n",
       "to him on the road? Had he failed in his examination? A circumstance\n",
       "occurred in her little household to add to her uneasiness and fill her\n",
       "mind with foreboding. It was almost equal to the escapado of her pigeon.\n",
       "Her tortoise-shell cat eloped at night and clambered to the tiled roof\n",
       "of the Alhambra. In the dead of the night there was a fearful\n",
       "caterwauling; some grimalkin was uncivil to her; then there was a\n",
       "scramble; then a clapper-clawing; then both parties rolled off the roof\n",
       "and tumbled from a great height among the trees on the hill-side.\n",
       "Nothing more was seen or heard of the fugitive, and poor Dolores\n",
       "considered it but the prelude to greater calamities.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the end of ten days, however, Manuel returned in triumph, duly\n",
       "authorized to kill or cure; and all Dolores’ cares were over. There was\n",

       "of Dame Antonio to congratulate her and to pay their respects to _el\n",
       "Señor Medico_, who, peradventure, at some future day, might have all\n",

       "damnable arts were secretly taught by an ancient sacristan; or, as some\n",

       "There was at one time a student of Salamanca, Don Vicente by name, of\n",

       "for a meal or a night’s lodgings.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he passed by the stone cross in the seminary square, he pulled off\n",
       "his hat and made a short invocation to St. Cyprian, for good luck; when\n",
       "casting his eyes upon the earth, he perceived something glitter at the\n",
       "foot of the cross. On picking it up, it proved to be a seal-ring of\n",
       "mixed metal, in which gold and silver appeared to be blended. The seal\n",
       "bore as a device two triangles crossing each other, so as to form a\n",
       "star. This device is said to be a cabalistic sign, invented by King\n",
       "Solomon the Wise, and of mighty power in all cases of enchantment; but\n",
       "the honest student, being neither sage nor conjurer, knew nothing of the\n",
       "matter. He took the ring as a present from St. Cyprian in reward of his\n",
       "prayer; slipped it on his finger, made a bow to the cross, and strumming\n",
       "his guitar, set off merrily on his wandering.\n",
       "\n",
       "The life of a mendicant student in Spain is not the most miserable in\n",
       "the world; especially if he has any talent at making himself agreeable.\n",
       "He rambles at large from village to village, and city to city,\n",
       "where-ever curiosity or caprice may conduct him. The country curates,\n",
       "who, for the most part, have been mendicant students in their time, give\n",
       "him shelter for the night, and a comfortable meal, and often enrich him\n",
       "with several quartos, or halfpence in the morning. As he presents\n",
       "himself from door to door in the streets of the cities, he meets with no\n",
       "harsh rebuff, no chilling contempt, for there is no disgrace attending\n",

       "of his occasional haunts was the fountain of Avellanos, in the valley of\n",
       "Darro. It is one of the popular resorts of Granada, and has been so\n",

       "the sun shone upon the red battlements of the latter, which beetled far\n",

       "ensuing day. The ravine was overshadowed by fig-trees, vines, and\n",
       "myrtles, and the outer towers and walls of the fortress. It was dark and\n",
       "lonely, and the twilight-loving bats began to flit about. At length the\n",
       "soldier halted at a remote and ruined tower, apparently intended to\n",
       "guard a Moorish aqueduct. He struck the foundation with the but-end of\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "But little preparation was necessary for my departure. A two-wheeled\n",

       "be the travelling equipage of a young Englishman and myself through\n",
       "Murcia, to Alicant and Valencia, on our way to France; and a long-limbed\n",
       "varlet, who had been a contrabandista, and, for aught I knew, a robber,\n",
       "was to be our guide and guard. The preparations were soon made, but the\n",
       "departure was the difficulty. Day after day was it postponed; day after\n",
       "day was spent in lingering about my favorite haunts, and day after day\n",
       "they appeared more delightful in my eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "The social and domestic little world also, in which I had been moving,\n",
       "had become singularly endeared to me; and the concern evinced by them at\n",
       "my intended departure, convinced me that my kind feelings were\n",
       "reciprocated. Indeed, when at length the day arrived, I did not dare\n",
       "venture upon a leave-taking at the good Dame Antonia’s; I saw the soft\n",
       "heart of little Dolores, at least, was brim full and ready for an\n",
       "overflow. So I bade a silent adieu to the palace and its inmates, and\n",
       "descended into the city as if intending to return. There, however, the\n",
       "tartana and the guide were ready; so, after taking a noonday’s repast\n",
       "with my fellow-traveller at the Posada, I set out with him on our\n",
       "journey.\n",
       "\n",
       "Humble was the cortege and melancholy the departure of El Rey Chico the\n",
       "second! Manuel, the nephew of Tia Antonia, Mateo, my officious but now\n",
       "disconsolate squire, and two or three old invalids of the Alhambra with\n",
       "whom I had grown into gossiping companionship, had come down to see me\n",
       "off; for it is one of the good old customs of Spain, to sally forth\n",
       "several miles to meet a coming friend, and to accompany him as far on\n",
       "his departure. Thus then we set out, our long-legged guard striding\n",
       "ahead, with his escopeta on his shoulder; Manuel and Mateo on each side\n",
       "of the tartana, and the old invalids behind.\n",
       "\n",
       "At some little distance to the north of Granada, the road gradually\n",
       "ascends the hills; here I alighted and walked up slowly with Manuel, who\n",
       "took this occasion to confide to me the secret of his heart and of all\n",
       "those tender concerns between himself and Dolores, with which I had been\n",
       "already informed by the all-knowing and all-revealing Mateo Ximenes. His\n",
       "doctor’s diploma had prepared the way for their union, and nothing more\n",
       "was wanting but the dispensation of the Pope, on account of their\n",
       "consanguinity. Then, if he could get the post of Medico of the fortress,\n",
       "his happiness would be complete! I congratulated him on the judgment and\n",
       "good taste he had shown in his choice of a helpmate; invoked all\n",
       "possible felicity on their union, and trusted that the abundant\n",
       "affections of the kind-hearted little Dolores would in time have more\n",
       "stable objects to occupy them than recreant cats and truant pigeons.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was indeed a sorrowful parting when I took leave of these good people\n",
       "and saw them slowly descend the hills; now and then turning round to\n",
       "wave me a last adieu. Manuel, it is true, had cheerful prospects to\n",
       "console him, but poor Mateo seemed perfectly cast down. It was to him a\n",
       "grievous fall from the station of prime minister and historiographer, to\n",
       "his old brown cloak and his starveling mystery of ribbon-weaving; and\n",
       "the poor devil, notwithstanding his occasional officiousness, had,\n",
       "somehow or other, acquired a stronger hold on my sympathies than I was\n",
       "aware of. It would have really been a consolation in parting, could I\n",
       "have anticipated the good fortune in store for him, and to which I had\n",
       "contributed; for the importance I had appeared to give to his tales and\n",
       "gossip and local knowledge, and the frequent companionship in which I\n",
       "had indulged him in the course of my strolls, had elevated his idea of\n",
       "his own qualifications and opened a new career to him; and the son of\n",
       "the Alhambra has since become its regular and well-paid cicerone;\n",
       "insomuch that I am told he has never been obliged to resume the ragged\n",
       "old brown cloak in which I first found him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Towards sunset I came to where the road wound into the mountains, and\n",
       "here I paused to take a last look at Granada. The hill on which I stood\n",
       "commanded a glorious view of the city, the Vega, and the surrounding\n",
       "mountains. It was at an opposite point of the compass from _La cuesta de\n",
       "las lagrimas_ (the hill of tears) noted for the “last sigh of the Moor.”\n",
       "I now could realize something of the feelings of poor Boabdil when he\n",
       "bade adieu to the paradise he was leaving behind, and beheld before him\n",
       "a rugged and sterile road conducting him to exile.\n",
       "\n",
       "The setting sun as usual shed a melancholy effulgence on the ruddy\n",
       "towers of the Alhambra. I could faintly discern the balconied window of\n",
       "the Tower of Comares, where I had indulged in so many delightful\n",
       "reveries. The bosky groves and gardens about the city were richly\n",
       "gilded with the sunshine, the purple haze of a summer evening was\n",
       "gathering over the Vega; everything was lovely, but tenderly and sadly\n",
       "so, to my parting gaze.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I will hasten from this prospect,” thought I, “before the sun is set. I\n",

       "\n",
       "With these thoughts I pursued my way among the mountains. A little\n",
       "further and Granada, the Vega, and the Alhambra were shut from my view;\n",
